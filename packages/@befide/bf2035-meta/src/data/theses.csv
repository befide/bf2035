"5HFR5HYC","thesis","2015","Flisgen, Thomas","Compact state-space models for complex superconducting radio-frequency structures based on model order reduction and concatenation methods","","","","","http://cds.cern.ch/search?p=CERN-ACC- 2015-0145","@en: The modeling of large chains of superconducting cavities with couplers is a challeng- ing task in computational electrical engineering. The direct numerical treatment of these structures can easily lead to problems with more than ten million degrees of freedom. Problems of this complexity are typically solved with the help of parallel programs running on supercomputing infrastructures. However, these infrastructures are expensive to purchase, to operate, and to maintain. The aim of this thesis is to introduce and to validate an approach which allows for modeling large structures on a standard workstation. The novel technique is called State-Space Concatena- tions and is based on the decomposition of the complete structure into individual segments. The radio-frequency properties of the generated segments are described by a set of state-space equations which either emerge from analytical considera- tions or from numerical discretization schemes. The model order of these equations is reduced using dedicated model order reduction techniques. In a final step, the reduced-order state-space models of the segments are concatenated in accordance with the topology of the complete structure. The concatenation is based on alge- braic continuity constraints of electric and magnetic fields on the decomposition planes and results in a compact state-space system of the complete radio-frequency structure. Compared to the original problem, the number of degrees of freedom is drastically reduced, i.e. a problem with more than ten million degrees of freedom can be reduced on a standard workstation to a problem with less than one thousand degrees of freedom. The final state-space system allows for determining frequency- domain transfer functions, field distributions, resonances, and quality factors of the complete structure in a convenient manner. This thesis presents the theory of the state-space concatenation approach and discusses several validation and application examples. The examples show that the resulting compact state-space models accu- rately describe the radio-frequency properties of the full structure and that the error introduced by the model order reduction and the concatenation of the segments is smaller than the error arising from the numerical treatment of the segments. In conclusion, the state-space concatenation scheme enables the investigation of radio- frequency properties of large structures without the application of supercomputers. @de: Die Modellierung von Ketten supraleitender Hohlraumresonatoren mit Kopplern ist eine anspruchsvolle Aufgabe der rechnergest¨ utzten Elektrotechnik. Die direk- te numerische Behandlung solcher Strukturen f¨ uhrt zu Problemen mit mehr als zehn Millionen Freiheitsgraden. Probleme dieser Komplexit¨ at lassen sich typischer- weise nur mit Hilfe paralleler Programme l¨ osen, die auf modernen Hochleistungs- rechnern ausgef¨ uhrt werden. Hochleistungsrechner sind allerdings teuer in der An- schaﬀung, im Betrieb und in der Wartung. Das Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit ist die Einf¨ uhrung und die Validierung eines neuartigen Verfahrens, das die Modellierung von großen und komplexen Hochfrequenzstrukturen auf einem Arbeitsplatzrechner erm ¨ oglicht. Das neuartige Verfahren tr¨ agt den englischen Namen State-Space Con- catenations und basiert auf der Zerlegung der Gesamtstruktur in einzelne Segmen- te. Die Hochfrequenzeigenschaften der Einzelsegmente werden dabei durch einen Satz von Zustandsmodellen beschrieben. Je nach Geometrie der Segmente werden deren Zustandsmodelle entweder durch kontinuierliche oder diskrete Verfahren er- stellt. In einem folgenden Schritt wird die Modellordnung der Zustandsmodelle mit Hilfe von entsprechenden Techniken reduziert. Abschließend werden die reduzier- ten Zustandsmodelle der Segmente gem¨ aß der Topologie der Gesamtstruktur zu einem Zustandsmodell verk¨ upft. Diese Verkettung basiert auf algebraisch formu- lierten Kontinuit¨ atsbedingungen f¨ ur das elektrische und das magnetische Feld an den Schnittfl¨ achen und liefert ein kompaktes Zustandsmodell der Gesamtstruktur. Im Vergleich zum Ursprungsproblem ist die Anzahl der Freiheitsgrade dieses Zu- standsmodells erheblich reduziert. Ein Problem mit zehn Millionen Freiheitsgra- den kann auf einem Arbeitsplatzrechner zu einem Problem mit weniger als tau- send Freiheitsgraden zur¨ uckgef¨ uhrt werden. Das erstellte Zustandsmodell erm¨ oglicht die schnelle Berechnung von Hochfrequenzeigenschaften der Gesamtstruktur, zum ¨ Beispiel Ubertragungsfunktionen im Frequenzbereich, Feldverteilungen, Resonan- zen und G¨ uten. Die vorliegende Arbeit beschreibt die Theorie der Methode der Verkopplung von Zustandsmodellen und diskutiert Validierungs- und Anwendungs- beispiele. Die Beispiele zeigen, dass die erzeugten kompakten Zustandsmodelle die Hochfrequenzeigenschaften der Gesamtstruktur pr¨ azise widerspiegeln. Der Fehler durch die Modellordnungsreduktion und die Verkn¨ upfung ist geringer als der durch die Diskretisierung der Einzelsegmente enstandene Fehler. Abschließend l¨ asst sich feststellen, dass die Methode der Verkopplung von Zustandsmodellen die Untersu- chung von Hochfrequenzeigenschaften komplexer Strukturen ohne den Einsatz von Hochleistungsrechnern erlaubt.","2015","2023-02-15 05:36:46","2024-12-11 03:48:01","","","166","","","","","","","","","","Universität Rostock","","en","","Doctoral dissertation","","","","","degree: Dr.-Ing.","","","","#gender/male; #university/uni-rostock; #accelerating-techniques/srf-structures; #degree/dr.ing.; #research-method/numerical-methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal is to provide femtosecond coherent VUVradiation pulses for time-resolved pump-probe experiments. CHG is based on the interaction of ultrashort laser pulses with electrons in an undulator to generate synchrotron radiation pulses of similar length, but at coherent harmonics of the laser wavelength. The goals of this PhD thesis were the characterization of the CHG pulses and the preparation of the first pump-probe experiments with the new light source. The CHG pulses were characterized using different methods which are applied either at a diagnostics beamline in air (for long wavelengths of 200 nm and above) or at an evacuated VUV beamline (for 200 nm and below). The characterization includes studying the transverse and longitudinal coherence properties of the CHG pulses, the intensity of the radiation, its angular and spectral distribution, estimate of the energy modulation, and the dependence of these properties on different parameters. In order to perform pump-probe experiments, an evacuated laser beamline of 53 m length was constructed and commissioned to guide some part of the laser pulses to the experimental station at the VUV beamline. This included optimizing and focusing the laser beam, realizing the temporal and transverse overlap between pump and probe pulses, controlling and monitoring the beam position with motorized in-vacuum mirrors and diagnostics screens, and stabilizing the angle and position of the beam using an optical feedback system.","2015","2023-02-15 05:36:46","2024-12-09 22:40:41","","","","","","","","","","","","","Technische Universität Dortmund","","en","","Doctoral dissertation","","","","","DOI: 10.17877/DE290R-7053 university-catalog-url: https://eldorado.tu-dortmund.de/handle/2003/33920 fulltext-url: https://eldorado.tu-dortmund.de/bitstream/2003/33920/1/Dissertation.pdf","","","","#university/tu-dortmund","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"DA5CCYBS","thesis","2019","Weilbach, Tobias","Minimal-invasive strahldiagnose für hoch intensive Elektronenstrahlen","","","","","https://openscience.ub.uni-mainz.de/handle/20.500.12030/962","Durch die Nutzung der Energierückgewinnung in Beschleunigern, wie z.B. in Energy recovery linacs (ERL) und Elektronenkühlern, können Strahlleistungen erzeugt werden, die bisher ökonomisch nicht erreichbar waren. Dabei werden Leistungen von einigen 10 kW bis zu einigen MW bei Strahlenergien unter 10 MeV erreicht. Ohne Energierückgewinnung müsste dafür eine Hochfrequenzleistung in vergleichbarer Größe installiert sein, was höhere Investitions- und Betriebskosten bedeuten würde. Diese hochintensiven Elektronenstrahlen stellen, speziell unterhalb von 10 MeV, besondere Anforderungen an die Strahldiagnose. Durch die hohen Strahlleistungen werden Diagnoseelemente, wie z.B. Szintillationsschirme, die in den Strahlengang gefahren werden, um das Strahlprofil zu vermessen, beschädigt bzw. zerstört. Im Rahmen der Energierückgewinnung wirkt sich jeder Verlust von Elektronen auf die Effizienz des Rückgewinnungsprozesses aus, da die Energie dieser Elektronen nicht mehr zurückgewonnen werden kann. Daher sind minimal-invasive Diagnosemethoden notwendig, die auf Prozessen mit einer möglichst kleinen Wechselwirkung mit dem Strahl beruhen. Diese Arbeit untersucht zwei Methoden der minimal-invasiven Strahldiagnose auf ihre Anwendungsmöglichkeiten für hoch intensive Elektronenstrahlen. Die erste Methode beruht auf der strahlinduzierten Fluoreszenz (Beam-Induced Fluorescence: BIF). Dabei wird das Licht, das durch die Anregung der Restgasatome und -moleküle im Strahlvakuum erzeugt wird, auf einen Detektor abgebildet. Die zweite Methode beruht auf der Thomson-Streuung. Dabei werden die Photonen eines Lasers am Elektronenstrahl gestreut, gewinnen Energie und werden im Detektor nachgewiesen. Der Laser tastet den Elektronenstrahl ab und erlaubt analog zur Messung mit einem Draht eine Profilmessung, da die Streurate proportional zur Elektronendichte projiziert auf den Laserweg ist. Diese Anwendung wird als Thomson-Laser-Scanner (TLS) bezeichnet. Die Wellenlänge der gestreuten Photonen hängt vom Winkel, unter dem sie den Elektronenstrahl treffen, und von der Energie der Elektronen ab, sowie der Wellenlänge des Lasers selbst. Für die Experimente wurde die in Mainz existierende Polarisierte KAnone Test (PKAT) um eine Messkammer zur Messung der strahlinduzierten Fluoreszenz (BIF) erweitert. Die Herausforderung dabei war es, das Vakuum im Bereich der BIF-Messung (10e-5 mbar) vom Vakuum der Photoquelle (10e-11 mbar) zu entkoppeln, so dass es zu keiner unakzeptablen Verkürzung der Vakuumlebensdauer der verwendeten Kathoden kommt. Für die TLS-Experimente wurde ein geeignetes Lasersystem erworben, um einerseits den benötigten Strahlstrom von 25 mA zu erzeugen und andererseits die erforderliche mittlere Laserleistung von mindestens 100 W für die Thomson-Streuung zur Verfügung zu stellen. Dabei konnte der Transport des Spitzenstroms von 25 mA gewährleistet werden, wobei der kombinierte Signaluntergrund von Elektronen- und Laserstrahl auf einen Wert <10 Hz begrenzt werden konnte. Die Bedingungen, unter denen an der PKAT gemessen wurde, sind auf die möglichen Anwendungsgebiete wie z.,B. den Elektronenkühler am Hochenergie-Speicherring (HESR) an der Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) oder ERLs wie den Mainz Energy recovering Superconducting Accelerator (MESA) übertragbar, so dass im Besonderen entscheidende Erkenntnisse über die Signal-zu-Untergrundverhältnisse sowie Messzeiten gewonnen werden konnten. Die vorgestellten Diagnosemethoden sind geeignete Erweiterungen im Bereich der minimal-invasiven Strahldiagnose für hoch intensive Elektronenstrahlen. Using energy recovering techniques in accelerators, e.g. in ERLs or electron coolers, a new range of beam powers is economically achievable. Beam powers in the order of several 10 kW up to several MW are possible at beam energies below 10 MeV. Without energy recovering methods, the same amount of radio frequency power has to be provided if the losses in the cavities are neglected. With energy recovering schemes, it is possible to achieve these beam powers economically because the needed radio frequency (RF) power is smaller and, thus, so are the investment and operating costs. Beam profile measurements of high intensity electron beams below 10 MeV have to fulfill special demands. Commonly used diagnostic tools like wire scanners and scintillation screens which are put in the beam path for profile measurements are not able to withstand the beam power without being damaged or destroyed. Due to the energy recovering mechanism, any electron loss reduces the efficiency of the recovering process because the energy of these electrons cannot be recovered anymore. This loss has to be covered by the installed RF power. Hence, minimally invasive diagnostic methods are needed, which rely on processes with interactions as small as possible with the beam and which remove as few electrons as possible from the beam, none in an optimal case. An established method for the beam profile measurement uses synchrotron radiation, but this can only be used at higher beam energies than those considered here. In this thesis, two different minimally invasive beam diagnostic methods are investigated with respect to their use for high intensity electron beams. The first method uses beam-induced fluorescence (BIF). This quite simple system images the light generated by the interaction of the beam with the residual gas onto a detector. The second method is based on Thomson scattering where laser photons are scattered at an electron beam, gain energy and are detected. The laser scans the electron beam and enables a profile measurement analogous to a wire measurement, hence the name Thomson Laser Scanner (TLS). The scattering rate is proportional to the projected electron density along the laser path, provided the detector system is capable of detecting all scattered photons. The wavelength of the scattered photons depends on the angle at which the laser hits the electron beam and on the energy of the electrons and the initial laser wavelength. The existing test source PKAT in Mainz was extended with a vacuum chamber for the BIF measurements. The challenge for the BIF measurements is the separation of the vacuum inside the BIF chamber 10e-5 mbar) from the vacuum in the photo source (10e-11 mbar) to prevent a significant decrease of the cathode's vacuum lifetime. For the TLS experiments a suitable laser system was acquired to provide the needed beam current of 25 mA and the required laser power of at least 100 W for the Thomson scattering experiments. In this process the transport of a peak current of 25 mA could be provided while keeping the combined background of the electron and the Laser beam below 10 Hz. The measurement conditions at the PKAT are transferable to different fields of application, e.g. the electron cooling device in the High Energy Storage Ring (HESR) at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) or ERLs like the Mainz Energy recovering Superconducting Accelerator (MESA), thus it is possible to gain knowledge about the signal-to-background ratio and measurement times. The presented methods are viable extensions of the minimally invasive beam diagnostics for high intensity electron beams.","2019","2023-02-15 05:36:53","2024-12-11 03:31:08","","","121","","","","","","","","","","Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz","","en","","Doctoral dissertation","","","DOI.org (Datacite)","","affiliation2:him","","","","#gender/male; #university/uni-mainz; #facility/mesa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Die Idee wurde zuerst von M. Tigner vorgeschlagen [1]. In einem ERL werden die Elektronen von der Quelle in die Beschleunigungsstrukturen geleitet und dann für z.B. minimalinvasive Teilchenphysik-Experimente [2] oder zur Erzeugung brillianter Strahlung genutzt [3]. Nach der Interaktion mit dem Experiment werden die Elektronen erneut mit einem Phasenvorschub von 180° in die Beschleunigungsstrukturen geleitet. Die Teilchen werden dadurch abgebremst und ihre kinetische Energie wird an das elektromagnetische Feld der Beschleunigerstrukturen zurückgegeben. Der Mainz Energy-recovering Superconducting Accelerator (MESA) wird zurzeit an der Johannes Gutenberg-Universität aufgebaut. Für Phase 1 von MESA wird ein Strahlstrom von 1mA viermal in zwei Kryomodulen bis auf eine Energie von 105MeV beschleunigt. 100MeV der Strahlenergie können zurückgewonnen werden und der Strahl wird bei 5MeV gestoppt. Dies führt zu einer signifikanten Einsparung von Anschlussleistung, benötigt aber supraleitende Beschleunigungsstrukturen, die bei 1,8K betrieben werden und hohe Güten aufweisen müssen, um die zur Beschleunigung notwendigen Feldstärken aufrecht zu erhalten. Für die zweite Phase von MESA ist Strahlbetrieb mit bis zu 10mA vorgesehen. Elektronenstrahlen mit hohem Strahlstrom stellen spezielle Anforderungen an die Strahldynamik, unter anderem durch Raumladung bei niedrigen Strahlenergien und durch das so genannte Beam Break Up (BBU), welches durch Dipol-Moden höherer Ordnung (Higher Order Modes (HOMs)) in den Beschleunigungsstrukturen ausgelöst wird. Die Messung der Moden höherer Ordnung, die am Helmholtz-Institut Mainz (HIM) durchgeführt wurde, ihr Einfluss auf die Strahldynamik und die Beschränkungen des maximalen Strahlstroms durch BBU werden in dieser Arbeit vorgestellt.","2020","2023-02-15 05:36:53","2024-12-11 03:25:22","","","","","","","","","","","","","Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz","Mainz","en","","Doctoral dissertation","","","","","","","","","#gender/male; #university/uni-mainz; #facility/mesa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Damit bei hochpräzisen Streuexperimenten mithilfe von Beschleunigern innerhalb einer angemessenen Zeit die Messgrößen mit einem kleinen statistischen Fehler gemessen werden können, sind deutlich höhere Strahlintensitäten notwendig, als sich mit einem konventionellen Linearbeschleuniger erzielen lassen. Im Fall des geplanten Beschleunigers MESA in Mainz werden Ströme bis zu 10 mA angestrebt. Um die hohe Strahlleistung bereitzustellen und auch thermisch zu beherrschen, wird der Strahl nach dem Durchlauf des Experiments erneut durch die Beschleunigerstrukturen gelenkt, die dann abbremsend wirken, und der Großteil der Leistung so zurückgewonnen. Dieses Konzept des energierückgewinnenden Linearbeschleunigers (ERL) kann auch für eine neue Generation von Synchrotronstrahlungsquellen zur Material- und Grundlagenforschung eingesetzt werden. Die Qualität des Strahls, beschrieben durch die Emittanzen, ist im Wesentlichen durch die Elektronenquelle bestimmt. Deshalb gestaltet sich ein ERL auch deutlich flexibler als ein Speicherring, wo die Emittanz durch das Gleichgewicht zwischen Strahlungsdämpfung und diversen Heizeffekten festgelegt ist. Für eine gute Strahlqualität des geplanten ERL ist eine sorgfältige Auslegung der Elektronenquelle und der Niederenergiestrahlführung wichtig. Diese Arbeit umfasst die Auswahl der Strahlführungsmagnete, deren Simulation und Vermessung. Dasselbe trifft auf das für die longitudinale Strahlanpassung wichtige Choppersystem zu. Darüber hinaus wurde die gesamte Teststrahlführung simuliert und in Zusammenarbeit aufgebaut. Um Strahlen mit sehr kleiner Emittanz zu Kalibrierzwecken zu erzeugen, wurde ein neues Lasersystem installiert. Normierte Emittanzen epsilon ¡ 1 mm mrad sollen am Experiment zur Verfügung stehen. In Kombination mit den hohen Strahlströmen kommt es zu hohen Ladungsdichten und somit starken Raumladungskräften. Diese nicht linearen Kräfte führen zu einer ungewollten Vergrößerung der Emittanzen. Aufgrund der 1/γ³-Abhängigkeit sind diese Effekte besonders in der Niederenergiestrahlführung zu beachten. Die raumladungsbedingte Vergrößerung der Emittanzen wurde mithilfe der Simulationen der Strahlführung bestimmt und mit dem Experiment verglichen. Hinzu kommt das Emittanzwachstum durch ungewollte Multipolfelder. Deren Anteil kann mit Simulationen der modellierten Magnete bestimmt werden. Mit geeigneter Diagnose wurden an mehreren Orten entlang der Teststrahlführung die transversalen Strahleigenschaften bestimmt und anschließend mit den Ergebnissen der Simulationen verglichen. Somit konnte der starke Einfluss der Multipole nachgewiesen werden.","2021","2023-02-15 05:36:53","2024-12-11 03:23:51","","","154","","","","","","","","","","Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz","Mainz","de","","Doctoral dissertation","","","","","DOI:  http://doi.org/10.25358/openscience-5654 fulltext-url: https://openscience.ub.uni-mainz.de/bitstream/20.500.12030/5658/1/matejcek_christoph-strahldynamik_-20210218135741640.pdf univertsity-catalog-url: https://openscience.ub.uni-mainz.de/handle/20.500.12030/5658","","","","#gender/male; #university/uni-mainz; #facility/mesa; #degree/dr.rer.nat.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Da hier unter anderem auch die longitudinale Präparation des Elektronenstrahles stattfindet, eignet sich dieser Aufbau zur Untersuchung der Länge der Teilchenpulse. Eine Diagnosemethode zur Bestimmung der Bunchlänge stellt Smith-Purcell-Strahlung (SPR)dar. SPR entsteht, wenn ein geladenes Teilchen nahe an einer periodischen metallischen Gitterstruktur vorbeifliegt. Die Strahlung hat einen kohärenten Anteil, der quadratisch mit dem Strahlstrom ansteigt und bei den hier auftretenden Bunchladungen von 0,77pC die Intensität um bis zu sechs Größenordnungen verstärkt, sobald die Bunchlänge des Elektronenstrahles kleiner ist als die Periode der Gitterstruktur. Verschiedene Gitter mit unterschiedlichen Gitterkonstanten werden neben dem Strahl positioniert, um so die Länge der Bunche zu bestimmen. Ein Vergleich mit der theoretisch erzeugten und experimentell bestimmten Leistung liefert hier noch genauere Ergebnisse. Die entstehende Strahlung im THz-Bereich wird mit Leistungen von wenigen pW bis zu maximal 30nW emittiert und in einem mit flüssigem Helium auf 4,2K gekühlten Bolometer nachgewiesen. Die Einstellung der Parameter des Systems zur longitudinalen Präparation des Teilchenstrahls (Bunchersystem) wird mit Hilfe dieses SPR-Signals zunächst grob vorgenommen und dann fein optimiert. Die Erzeugung von SPR erfolgt dabei minimal invasiv. Es wird gezeigt, dass es möglich ist, die Bunchlänge zu bestimmen und dabei weniger als 0,6% des Strahles zu verlieren, wobei mit einer genaueren Einstellung der Fokussier- und Ablenkmagnete auch Werte von deutlich unter 0,1% möglich wären. Diese Eigenschaft ermöglicht es auch, bei hohen Strahlströmen eine Bunchlängenmessung durchzuführen. Hier bewirkt eine gegenseitige Abstoßung der Elektronen eine Aufblähung des Bunches (Raumladung). Der Einfluss dieses Effekts wird reduziert, indem bei einer Live-Messung bei Strömen von bis zu 3mA die Hohlraumresonatoren des Bunchersystems nachgeregelt werden. Es zeigt sich, dass sich mit diesem System RMS-Bunchlängen von 70µm erzeugen lassen. Dabei entspricht die experimentelle Anordnung weitgehend den zu erwartenden Verhältnissen an MESA. Die durch die Akzeptanz des Beschleunigers von 1,7mm festgelegte Anforderung wird hierbei deutlich übertroffen.","2021","2023-02-15 05:36:53","2024-12-11 03:26:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz","Mainz","de","","Doctoral dissertation","","","","","item-url: http://doi.org/10.25358/openscience-5886 fulltext-url:","","","","#gender/male; #university/uni-mainz; #facility/mesa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"KRU82DSP","thesis","2018","Alexander, Igor Constantin","Experimental investigation of the beam dynamics of the MESA photoinjector","","","","","https://openscience.ub.uni-mainz.de/handle/20.500.12030/1178","Das Institut für Kernphysik der Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz baut einen neuen Beschleuniger mit der Bezeichnung “Mainz Energy-recovering Superconducting Accelerator” (MESA). MESA wird, ähnlich wie das bereits existierende Mainz Mikrotron (MAMI), ein rezirkulierender Beschleuniger sein, der einen c.w. Strahl mit einer Frequenz von 1,3 GHz liefern wird. Im sogenannten ERL Betrieb soll der mittlere Strahlstrom zunächst 1 mA betragen, was in einer weiteren Ausbaustufe auf 10 mA erhöht werden wird. Für einen zuverlässigen Betrieb des Beschleunigers ist die Strahlqualität entscheidend, die durch die Emittanz beschrieben wird. Die normierte Emittanz des Elektronenstrahls sollte epsilon_n < 1 mm mrad = 1 µm betragen und wird maßgeblich durch die Eigenschaften der Elektronenquelle deﬁniert. Durch die angestrebten Strahlströme von bis zu 10 mA in Verbindung mit einer Emittanz von epsilon_n,max = 1 µm können hohe Elektronendichten auftreten, welche durch die nichtlinearen Raumladungskräfte die Strahlqualität nachteilig beeinﬂussen. Deswegen ist eine geeignete Strahldiagnose unerlässlich, nicht zuletzt um die Eigenschaften der Elektronenquelle zu bestimmen, die sich aufgrund der Komplexität des Photoemissionsprozesses nur schwer modellieren lassen. Die vorliegende Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit Emittanzmessungen an niederenergetischen Elektronenstrahlen (100 keV) sowie der Messung der Elektronenpulslänge im Pikosekundenbereich. Für diesen Zweck wurde eine Teststrahlführung aufgebaut und die nötigen Diagnoseelemente wurden entwickelt und in Betrieb genommen. Die Strahldiagnoseeinheiten bestehen aus Leuchtschirmen und Drähten, mit denen Quadrupolscans ausgewertet werden können um eine Emittanzbestimmung durchzuführen. Zusätzlich sind auch noch Schlitzmasken verbaut, die eine Reduzierung der Raumladungskräfte während der Emittanzvermessung ermöglichen. Da die Strahldiagnoseelemente für den Betrieb an MESA konzipiert sind, werden diese unter realitätsnahen Bedingungen—wie sie auch später an MESA vorliegen—getestet. Anhand dieser Anforderungen wurde ein zuverlässiges Lasersystem aufgebaut und in Betrieb genommen. Das Lasersystem besteht aus zwei Laserdioden mit unterschiedlichen Wellenlängen und Pulseigenschaften. Dies ermöglicht es die Auswirkungen der zeitlichen Struktur der Bunche sowie der emittierenden Fläche auf die Entwicklung der Emittanz zu untersuchen. Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit konnten die Strahlparameter bis zu einem Strahlstrom von 2,4 mA bestimmt werden, was einer Bunchladung von 2 pC entspricht. Ein Deﬂektorresonator wurde verwendet, um die auftretenden Pulslängen zu charakterisieren. Die beobachteten Bunchlängen und Emittanzen für I_beam ≤ 1 mA sind ausreichend, um mit dem Betrieb von MESA zu beginnen. Die durchgeführten Messungen decken die Anforderungen für die erste Ausbaustufe von MESA ab. The Institute of Nuclear Physics at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz is building a new accelerator called Mainz Energy-recovering Superconducting Accelerator (MESA). MESA will be a recirculating machine like the existing Mainz Microtron (MAMI) delivering a c.w. electron beam with a repetition rate of 1.3 GHz. In the ERL operating mode the average beam current should be 1 mA, and in a second stage increased up to 10 mA. The beam quality, which is described by the emittance, is very important for a reliable accelerator operation. The normalized emittance of the electron beam should be epsilon_n < 1 mm mrad = 1 µm. The desired beam currents of up to 10 mA in combination with an emittance of epsilon_n,max = 1 µm create high electron densities. The latter will act as a detrimental eﬀect on the beam quality due to nonlinear space charge forces. Therefore, diagnostic elements are very important, in particular to characterize the properties of the electron source, since they are diﬃcult to simulate because of the complexity of photoemission. The thesis describes emittance measuring methods for low-energy electron beams (100 keV) and investigations of their temporal distribution in the picosecond regime. A diagnostic test beam line has been built, and the diagnostic elements have been designed and put into action. The diagnostic elements consist of screens and wires to perform quadrupole scans for the emittance determination. In addition, slit masks are installed, which allow to reduce space charge eﬀects during the emittance determination. Furthermore, a reliable laser system which allows to simulate the operating parameters of MESA has been constructed and commissioned. The laser system contains two diﬀerent laser diodes with diﬀerent wavelengths and enables to investigate the eﬀect of the temporal bunch structure and the emitter area on the evolution of the emittance within the low-energy beam transport system. The electron beam parameters could be determined up to a current of about 2.4 mA, which corresponds to a bunch charge of approximately 2 pC. A circular deﬂecting cavity was employed to characterize the bunch length of the electron pulses. With the existing electron source satisfying bunchlengths and emittances have been observed at I_beam ≤ 1 mA, which is suﬃcient to start MESA operations. The experiments performed cover the requirements for MESA stage-1.","2018","2023-02-15 05:36:53","2024-12-11 03:21:19","","","","","","","","","","","","","Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz","","en","","Doctoral dissertation","","","","","","","","","#gender/male; #university/uni-mainz; #facility/mesa; #degree/dr.rer.nat.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"XZHXTWCA","thesis","2014","Ignatenko, Alexandr","Development of Beam Halo Monitors for the European XFEL using radiation hard sensors and demonstration of the technology at FLASH","","","","","https://opus4.kobv.de/opus4-btu/frontdoor/index/index/year/2015/docId/3475","The European X-Ray Free-Electron Laser (E-XFEL), currently under construction in Hamburg, Germany, is intended to be an international linear accelerator (linac) based user facility. Its electron beam can carry maximal average power of 600 kW. A beam with such a high power needs to be carefully transmitted through the machine and safely dumped after utilization. This is supported by various diagnostics tools. A Beam Halo Monitor (BHM) based on synthetic diamond and sapphire sensors has been designed. Diamond sensors are developed by the company element6 for the detection of ionizing radiation and used previously elsewhere. Sapphire sensors are in this thesis applied for the first time. The BHM concept has been applied already at the Free-electron Laser in Hamburg (FLASH). A module with four diamond and four sapphire sensors was designed, installed inside the beam pipe, commissioned, calibrated and has been successfully operated for 4 years. The system contributed significantly to safe and efficient operation of FLASH. Both types of the sensors for the BHM were characterized. Measurements of radiation tolerance are done in a 10 MeV electron beam for polycrystalline CVD (pCVD) diamond sensors for the first time up to a dose of 10 MGy and for sapphire sensors up to 5 MGy. The charge collection efficiency (CCE) drops as a function of the absorbed dose, is however still sufficient for application as a BHM. To improve a main sensor characteristic, the charge collection efficiency, for sapphire sensors the impurity concentration was reduced and different growth techniques were compared. Finally, charge collection efficiency of about 5 % for a bias voltage of 500 V was reached. The BHM concept for the XFEL is designed and in the construction phase.… Der European X-Ray Free-Electron Laser (E-XFEL), dessen Aufbau zur Zeit in Hamburg stattfindet, soll als international organisierte LINAC basierte Strahlungsquelle für Nutzer betrieben werden. Die mittlere Leistung im Elektronenstrahl wird 600 kW betragen. Ein Strahl mit so hoher Leistung muss sicher durch den Beschleuniger gesteuert, und nach seiner Nutzung sicher am vorgesehenen Ort vernichtet werden. Die Führung des Strahls wird von verschiedenen Diagnoseinstrumenten unterstützt. Hierzu zählt ein Beam Halo Monitor, der  Sensoren aus hochreinem Diamant- und Saphirkristallen nutzt. Diamantsensoren wurden speziell für den Nachweis ionisierender Strahlung von der Firma Element6 entwickelt und wurden bereits an anderen Beschleunigen verwendet. Saphiresenoren werden in dieser Arbeit zum ersten Mal von verschiedenen Herstellern getestet und verwendet.  Das Konzept eines solchen Beam Halo Monitors wurde im Rahmen dieser Arbeit bereits beim Free-Electron Laser in Hamburg (FLASH) entwickelt und angewandt. Hier wurde ein Modul mit jeweils 4 Diamant- und 4 Saphirsensoren installiert, in Betrieb genommen und getestet. Seit nunmehr 4 Jahren ist es ohne Ausfall in Betrieb und hat in dieser Zeit signifikant zur Erhöhung der Effizienz von FLASH beigetragen. Vor dem Einbau bei FLASH wurden beide Sensortypen charakterisiert. Polykristaline CVD (pCVD) Diamantsensoren wurden in einem 10 MeV Elektronenstrahl mit bis zu 10 MGy und Saphirsensoren bis zu 5 MGy Dosis getestet. Die sogenannte Charge Collection Efficiency (CCE) fällt dabei in Abhängigkeit von der applizierten Dosis ab, bleibt aber immer noch ausreichend hoch, so dass die Sensoren für einen BHM verwendet werden können.  Ferner wurde der Einfluss der Reinheit von Saphirsensoren auf die Charge Collection Efficiency untersucht. Die Konzentration Verunreinigungen wurde bei Auswahl der Sensoren verringert, und verschiedene Herstellungsverfahren wurden betrachtet. Im Resultat konnten Sensoren mit einer Charge Collection Efficiency von 5% bei einer Spannung von 500 V hergestellt werden. Das Konzept für den XFEL ist entwickelt und bereits in der Phase der Realisierung.","2014","2023-02-15 06:39:57","2024-12-11 03:10:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","Brandenburgisch Technische Universität Cottbus-Senftenberg","","en","","Doctoral dissertation","","","","","","","","","#university/btu-cottbus-senftenberg; #gender/male; #facility/flash; #facility/euxfel; #components/beam-halo-monitors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The frequency of 263 GHz is an established figure for continuous wave (CW) DNP-NMR application and, therefore, the investigated source will allow the development of novel spectroscopy methods such as time-domain DNP-NMR for which powerful sub-THz pulses with highest coherency are required. For the first time, it is shown that the operation of the passive mode-locked helical gyro-TWTs in the hard excitation regime is of particular importance to reach the optimal coherency of the generated pulses. To enable the operation in the hard excitation regime, a new extended passive mode-locked oscillator is proposed. The extended passive mode-locked oscillator will furthermore enable the generation of specific pulse sequences in addition to the generation of pulses with constant repetition frequency. This could be of particular interest for some time-domain DNP-NMR methods where well-defined pulse sequences are required.","2022","2023-02-15 06:48:29","2024-12-11 03:48:43","","","282","","","","","","","","","","Karlsruher Institut für Technologie (KIT)","","en","","Doctoral dissertation (Dr. Ing.)","","","","","","","","","#university/kit; #gender/male; #degree/dr.ing.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Die Kühltemperaturen von CMRCs müssen für die HTS-Kühlung deutlich abgesenkt werden, was bisher mit einem starken Effizienzeinbruch verbunden war. Zudem sollten aus Sicherheitsgründen unbrennbare Kältemittelgemische statt der üblicherweise verwendeten Stickstoff-Kohlenwasserstoffgemischen eingesetzt werden. Hierfür wurde ein zweistufiger Gemischkältekaskadenprozess konzipiert, simuliert und teilweise experimentell umgesetzt. In der Prozesssimulation kam eine Peng-Robinson-Zustandsgleichung zum Einsatz, die für die Berechnung der Kältemittelgemische neu parametrisiert wurde. Fehlende Phasengleichgewichtsdaten für Systeme mit R1234yf wurden in eigenen Experimenten ermittelt.

One of the upgrades is the integration of the new LSA control system framework, which is licensed and adapted from CERN, in order to provide a unified control environment for all accelerators, rings and transfer lines at both the GSI and FAIR facility. As part of this work, it was possible to incorporate the FRS as a machine-model within LSA by developing and implementing Parameter hierarchies and Makerules to enable streamlined and maximum parallel operations. For this purpose a FRS General Target Hierarchy was implemented to virtually map targets, target ladders, degraders, degrader disks, degrader ladders, detectors and detector ladders as realistically as possible with additional Makerules to facilitate automated online energy-loss calculations, secondary beam production within targets, operator driven magnetic rigidity overwriting and ion-optical target alignment calculations. Additionally slits, pneumatic drives and stepper motors were introduced into the machine-model, as well. Benchmarking proved for the machine-model and LSA to be equivalent to previous control systems by reproducing old experimental settings within an accuracy of 10^-4 and 10^-3 for the magnetic rigidity and current, respectively. Contemporary experiments can be even identically reproduced within the measurement and setting precision. Additional testing with a Ar-40 and U-238 primary beam showed the machine-model's capabilities in correctly transporting primary and secondary beam fragments to the destined experimental station without previous setting calculation via LISE++, proving all functionalities operative. This foundation was used during FAIR Phase-0 experiments at the GSI to produce and using the methods described here it was possible to preliminarily identify up to 21 new isotopes with a relativistic Pb-208 primary beam at 1050 AMeV impinging on a beryllium target of 4 g/cm^2 thickness with a niobium stripper backing of 225 mg/cm^2 thickness to first produce Re-200, -201, -202, W-198, -199, Ta-195, -196, -197, Hf-191, -192, -193, Lu-189, -190, -191, Yb-186, -187, Tm-182, -183, -184, -185 and Er-181.","2023","2023-11-03 07:00:34","2024-12-11 03:20:47","","","245","","","","","","","","","","Technische Universität Darmstadt","Darmstadt","en","","Doctoral dissertation","","","","","DOI: 10.26083/tuprints-00023299 fulltext-url:https://tuprints.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/23299/5/Dissertation_Hucka_v1_published.pdf university-catalog-url: https://tuprints.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/23299/","","","","#university/tu-darmstadt; #gender/male; #facility/fair/super-frs; #degree/dr.rer.nat.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ultra-high vacuum conditions are achieved in all parts of the system. Atomic-hydrogen assisted low-temperature cleaning of cathodes in a chamber with base pressure better than 3 E-11 mbar is used for preparing clean cathode surfaces for negative electron affinity (NEA) activation. Using a standardised activation procedure, atomic-hydrogen cleaning of heavily contaminated bulk-GaAs samples is optimized to an upper limit of 10 kL hydrogen-dosage. Cleaning of samples has been performed with a dosage as low as 0.7 kL. Activation of photocathodes with Cs+O2 and Cs+Li+O2 have been studied in a dedicated vacuum chamber with base pressure better than 2 E-11 mbar. By using a 405 nm laser, quantum efficiencies above 25 % have been achieved from an NEA-GaAs photocathode. Oxygen-induced quantum-efficiency degradation of NEA cathodes has been investigated. A vacuum lifetime of (298+/-35) hours was observed in the activation chamber for a novel two-stage activation using Cs, O2 and Li. This system can provide photocathodes with high quantum efficiency and lifetime for polarized and unpolarized beam production at the 60 keV electron beamline of Photo-CATCH.

Radiation-induced premature beam aborts have been a limiting factor for accelerator availability in the recent years. Furthermore, the future upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider to its High Luminosity phase will further increase the radiation load and has higher requirements for the overall machine availability. Therefore equipment groups like the Quench protection groups have used the last years to redesign many of their systems to fulfill those requirements. In support of the development of radiation-tolerant systems, several proton beam irradiation campaigns were conducted to determine the inherent radiation tolerance of a selection of varied electronic components. Using components from this selection a new Quench Protection System for the 600 A corrector magnets was developed. The radiation tolerance of this system was further improved by developing a filter and error correction system for all discovered failure modes. Furthermore, compliance of the new system with the specification was shown by simulating the behavior of the system using data taken from the irradiation campaigns. The resulting system is operational since the beginning of 2016 and has in the first 9 months of operation not shown a single radiation-induced failure. Using results from simulations and irradiation campaigns the predicted failure cross section for the full new 600 A Quench Protection System is 4.358 ± 0.564 * 10^-10 cm2 which is one order of magnitude lower than the target set during the development of this system.","2017-07","2023-11-03 07:14:58","2024-12-09 22:34:56","","","129","","","","","","","","","","Technische Universität Darmstadt","Darmstadt","en","","Doctoral dissertation","","","","","university-catalog-url: https://tuprints.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/6300/ DOI:10.26083/tuprints-00017594 fulltext-url: https://tuprints.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/6300/1/PhDThesis_V2.pdf","","","","#university/tu-darmstadt; #gender/male","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"28SB69ZM","thesis","2014","Milosic, Timo","Feasibility Study on Longitudinal Phase-Space Measurements at GSI UNILAC using Charged-Particle Detectors","","","","","https://tuprints.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/4321/","Accelerator facilities require access to many beam parameters during operation. The field of beam instrumentation serves this crucial role in commissioning, setup and optimisation of the facility. An important information is contained in the phase-space distribution of the accelerated particles. In case of GSI (Helmholtzzentrum für Schwerionenforschung) those are ions from protons to uranium. If established methods to access certain beam parameters do not exist, new approaches have to emerge. This is the case for the presented measurement setup which has been designed and realised by Forck et al. to support commissioning of the GSI high-current injector. It is aiming at an experimental method to access the longitudinal phase-space distribution at low energies of 1.4 AMeV. Established methods for higher energies and based on the measurement of the electric field distribution are not feasible at non-relativistic velocities. The presented method is based on a time-of-flight (TOF) measurement between two particle detectors. A modification allows, alternatively, the direct measurement of the kinetic energy using a mono-crystalline (MC) diamond detector. Currently, besides others, the focus of the optimisation of the injector is put on the longitudinal phase-space distribution. It allows for a systematic optimisation of the matching into the accelerator cavities and, thus, an improved transmission as well as lower emittance values. The new accelerator facility FAIR (Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research), a large-scale upgrade at GSI, requires an improved beam quality at the existing injector. In this work the experimental setup is investigated for its feasibility to measure the longitudinal phase-space distribution. To this end, the phase and momentum of the single ions along the beam axis have to be determined with high precision. Finally, the longitudinal phase-space distribution is identified with the measured ensemble. The setup is presented in detail, introducing necessary concepts such as the phase space and emittance and is followed by a discussion of the data acquisition and data analysis. An important part of the latter is the introduction of a robust estimator for the covariance matrix of the measured distribution which is directly connected to the RMS emittance. However, the classical estimator is very sensitive to outliers in the measured data. The usual approach of subjective selection of cut regions is thereby avoided. The TOF setup has been tested with low and high current beams where a general sensitivity to the longitudinal phase-space distribution was confirmed. Furthermore, the gas pressure at the stripper section and the setup of the high-current slits, required for beam attenuation, have an impact on the measured distributions. Scattering of ions at the slits leads to a larger energy spread, larger bunch length and, consequently, emittance. Independent of the configuration, deviations from the expected values of the energy spread ∆E/⟨E⟩ ≈ 1 % and the Twiss parameter α ≈ 4 have been measured. The energy spreads were larger than the theory values by a factor of 1.5-1.6. However, a direct measurement of the bunch structure, while using sensible high-current slit settings, proved valuable. Low-current measurements with the MC diamond detector featured a gain loss of 5 % pulse height and 2 % pulse integral after irradiation with ≈ 3×10^4 argon ions. Although this effect is corrected in the data analysis, the energy spread is significantly larger than expected, like in the TOF measurements. Similarly, the values for α were below 0.5. Prominent trails in the measured distribution showed a broad energy spectrum and could be quantitatively attributed to interaction with the collimator apertures. As the measurements hint an insufficient energy resolution, this effect has been investigated in a Gaussian model space. The discrepancies between expected and measured values ∆E/⟨E⟩, α and emittance could be resolved by assuming a system response of 1.3 %. In the scope of this model space and knowledge of the TOF resolution an approximation to the real longitudinal phase-space parameter by back transformation of the covariance matrix was suggested. Furthermore, the Gaussian model space allowed to deduce an analytic formula for the required energy resolution. This showed a high dependency of the resolution on the Twiss parameter α which scales with 1/α. For instance, to target a precision of the emittance within 10 % requires a TOF resolution of better than 30 ps. This motivated a survey on the possible systematic contributions. The dominating contribution was found to be the inhomogeneity of the foils. The tantalum foil alone contributes an energy broadening of σE/⟨E⟩ ≈ 1 % and is of the same size of the expected energy spread of beam. Including all systematic sources quantitatively supports the considerations made in the Gaussian model space. While the experimental setup is not yet able to measure the full longitudinal phase-space distribution, it is capable of providing valuable information about the bunch structure. Several campaigns have been successfully supported with bunch-structure measurements.","2014-12-23","2023-11-03 07:22:40","2024-12-11 03:58:38","","","","","","","","","","","","","Technische Universität Darmstadt","Darmstadt","en","","Doctoral dissertation","","","","","university-catalog-url: https://tuprints.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/4321/1/Milosic_PhD-Thesis_2013.pdf fulltext-url: https://tuprints.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/4321/1/Milosic_PhD-Thesis_2013.pdf","","","","#university/tu-darmstadt; #gender/male","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"YTU5AI8U","thesis","2016","Bruker, Max-Wilhelm","Untersuchung der Rückgewinnungseffizienz eines Kühlerelektronenstrahls in longitudinalem Magnetfeld","","","","","https://openscience.ub.uni-mainz.de/handle/20.500.12030/4579","Ein grundlegendes Problem von Hadronenspeicherringen ist die Erzeugung und Aufrechterhaltung eines Strahls mit niedrigem Phasenraumvolumen. Da dieses als Folge des Liouville'schen Theorems in einem geschlossenen Teilchenensemble nicht nachträglich durch konservative Kräfte verkleinert werden kann, kommen Strahlkühlungsverfahren zur Anwendung, die die o.g. Bedingungen umgehen. Der Begriff Kühlung ist hier als thermodynamisches Analogon zu verstehen, da die unerwünschte Geschwindigkeitsverteilung im Ruhesystem des Sollteilchens gleichbedeutend mit einer Temperatur ist. Ein etabliertes Verfahren ist die Elektronenkühlung, bei der dem Hadronenstrahl ein Elektronenplasma überlagert wird, das sich im Ruhesystem des Sollteilchens in Ruhe befindet und eine im Vergleich niedrige Temperatur hat. Durch Mehrfachstreuung findet ein Temperaturaustausch statt, wobei das Elektronenplasma kontinuierlich erneuert wird und daher kalt bleibt. Im Laborsystem ist das Elektronenplasma ein DC-Strahl, dessen kinetische Energie sich zu der des Hadronenstrahls verhält wie die Massen der Teilchen. Gleichzeitig wächst die Kühlkraft mit der Elektronendichte, sodass Strahlströme im Bereich von 1 A gewünscht sind. Bei Elektronenenergien von einigen MeV, wie sie in zukünftigen Anwendungen, z.B. im HESR, benötigt werden, ist der Betrieb nur mit Energierückgewinnung möglich, d.h. Quelle und Kollektor sind ungefähr auf demselben Potential und der Elektronenstrom fließt nicht durch die Hochspannungsquelle. Die elektrostatische Symmetrie eines solchen Aufbaus bewirkt, dass Sekundärelektronen, die an der Oberfläche des Kollektors erzeugt werden, sich in der entgegengesetzten Richtung durch das Strahlrohr bewegen und in dem als Entschleunigungsstrecke gedachten Abschnitt beschleunigt werden. Die Eigenschaften dieses unerwünschten Strahls sind schlecht definiert, weshalb er teilweise mit Begrenzungsflächen kollidiert. Die dadurch entstehende Strombelastung der Hochspannungsquelle, die entstehende Röntgenstrahlung und die Verschlechterung der Vakuumbedingungen sind unerwünscht, weshalb ein Interesse daran besteht, die Sekundärelektronen möglichst stark zu unterdrücken. Diese Arbeit beschreibt den Aufbau eines Experiments, das die detaillierte Untersuchung des Verhaltens des Sekundärelektronenstrahls erlaubt. Der erreichte Primärstrahlstrom beträgt 550 mA bei einer Kathodenspannung von -17 kV. Auf den Einsatz einer weiteren Beschleunigungsstrecke für hohe Energien wurde bewusst verzichtet, weil sich die entscheidenden Erkenntnisse über den Sekundärelektronenstrahl auch ohne diese zusätzliche Komplikation erhalten lassen. Dadurch steht ein kompaktes Gerät zur Verfügung, dessen Verhalten sich mit wenig Aufwand in Computersimulationen vorhersagen und erklären lässt. Durch Einsatz eines Wien-Filters analog zum COSY-Kühler wird eine vollständige Unterdrückung der Sekundärelektronen erreicht. Es zeigt sich aber, dass das Ableiten dieser Teilchen wiederum Sekundärelektronen mit neuer Energie- und Winkelverteilung erzeugt, die von den elektrischen und magnetischen Feldern beeinflusst werden. Dieser Prozess setzt sich überall, wo die Elektronen auftreffen, fort, was eine vollständige Unterdrückung eines Teilchenrückflusses erschwert. Eine Untersuchung der Verlustströme bei der vorhandenen Geometrie in Verbindung mit detaillierten Tracking-Simulationen erlaubt die Abschätzung der nach dem Wien-Filter verbleibenden Verluste in der Größenordnung von 1e-9 relativ zum Gesamtstrom, was im Vergleich mit anderen Störeinflüssen wie Restgasionisation vernachlässigbar ist. Hadron storage rings face the challenge of injecting and maintaining a low-emittance beam, i.e. one that occupies a small volume in phase space. As a consequence of Liouville's theorem, this volume cannot be compressed by conservative forces given a fixed ensemble of particles, which leads to the application of beam cooling methods that circumvent these conditions. The term cooling is a reference to thermodynamics in that the undesired velocity distribution in the rest frame of the nominal particle corresponds to a temperature. One of the established beam cooling methods is that of electron cooling, which uses an electron plasma superimposed on the hadron beam. In the rest frame of the nominal hadron, this plasma is at rest and at a comparatively low temperature. Multiple scattering gives rise to a temperature exchange wherein the electron plasma remains cold as it is continuously renewed. In the laboratory frame, the electron plasma is a d.c.~beam, the kinetic energy of which is related to that of the hadron beam in the same ratio as the masses of the particles. At the same time, beam currents of the order of 1 A are desired as the cooling force increases with electron density. At an electron energy of several MeV as required in future applications, e.g. in the HESR, this kind of beam can only be supplied using energy recovery, i.e. source and collector are at about the same potential and the beam current does not load the high voltage source. As a result of the electrostatic symmetry of such a system, secondary electrons emitted from the collector surface can move through the beam pipe in the opposite direction, which results in them being accelerated in the deceleration section. This undesired beam has ill-defined properties and partially collides with limiting apertures. As the resulting loading of the high voltage source, emission of x-rays, and deterioration of vacuum conditions interfere with the operational stability of the device, it is desirable to suppress the secondary electrons as strongly as possible. This document presents a set-up that permits a detailed analysis of the behaviour of the secondary electron beam under conditions similar to those in a real electron cooler. A primary beam current of 550 mA was attained at a cathode voltage of -17 kV. In contrast to a real cooler, an acceleration section between the cathode and the beam pipe was intentionally omitted because investigation of the secondary beam is possible without this additional complication. This results in a compact device, the behaviour of which can be predicted and explained by computer simulations without much effort. Using a Wien filter similar to that employed in the COSY cooler, the secondary electron beam from the collector is completely suppressed. However, collecting these particles in turn creates new secondaries with a new distribution of energy and angle, which then interact with the electric and magnetic fields. This process takes place at all points where electrons are collected, complicating a complete suppression of backflow. With the given geometry, analysis of the measured loss currents and detailed tracking simulations permit to estimate the real remaining losses after the Wien filter to be of the order of 1e-9 relative to the total current, rendering them negligible in comparison to other undesired effects such as residual gas ionisation.","2016","2023-11-03 07:33:13","2024-12-11 03:29:54","","","121","","","","","","","","","","Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz","Mainz","de","","Doctoral dissertation","","","","","affiliation2:him university-catalog-url: https://openscience.ub.uni-mainz.de/handle/20.500.12030/4579 fulltext-url: https://openscience.ub.uni-mainz.de/bitstream/20.500.12030/4579/1/100000835.pdf","","","","#gender/male; #university/uni-mainz; #facility/cosy; #organisation/him; #facility/fair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This led to an inefficient energy gain and a deterioration of the beam quality in this acceleration structure. In order to optimize the performance of the injector, especially with regard to an accelerator operation in the energy-recovery mode, it was therefore necessary to replace the 5-cell cavity with a dedicated β-adapted capture structure. This project was implemented within the scope of this dissertation. A new β-reduced 6-cell structure was manufactured, tested and installed at the accelerator. Tuner frame components had to be adapted to the novel geometry and mechanical features of the cavity. To achieve an exchange of the cavities within a regular maintenance shutdown, full compatibility with the existing cryostat was prioritized during the design of the modified cryomodule components. In addition, a beam diagnostic setup was conceptualized, installed and commissioned upstream of the capture cavity. This setup was used to characterize momentum spreads of the beam along the normal-conducting injector section with a relative uncertainty of ±2 %. Furthermore, parameters of the beam entering the superconducting injector section, which have a significant influence on the achievable injector beam quality, could be optimized. After the cool-down of the installed capture cavity, full functionality of the upgraded cryomodule was shown. First beam parameter studies were conducted at the optimized injector. The results were benchmarked against the former injector setup. Besides a reduction of the momentum spread by a factor of around four, a substantially improved energy gain of up to 1.4 MeV was achieved in the new capture structure for an incident beam energy of 250 keV. Furthermore, a decreased bunch length was observed at the injector beam, which had already proven beneficial for the overall S-DALINAC performance during ERL experiments following the commissioning. The optimized injector is fully operational and is now available for further beam operation at the S-DALINAC.","2022","2023-11-03 07:39:34","2024-12-10 07:59:31","2023-11-03 07:39:34","","109","","","","","","","","","","Technische Universität Darmstadt","Darmstadt","en","","Doctoral dissertation","","","","","fulltext-url: https://tuprints.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/20632/1/Dissertation_Weih_genehmigt_v1.pdf DOI: 10.26083/tuprints-00020632 university-catalog-url: https://tuprints.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/20632/","","","","#university/tu-darmstadt; #gender/male; #facility/s-dalinac","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"YCIDEJRM","thesis","2023","Eggert, Tobias","Development of a Cryogenic DC Photoelectron Gun for GaAs Cathodes with Increased Charge Lifetime","","","","","https://tuprints.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/23275/","Electron beams can be generated by utilizing the internal photoelectric effect. In this matter, a special photocathode material is necessary for generating polarized electrons. Gallium arsenide (GaAs) proved to be the best choice. However, the production of polarized electrons requires a photo-emission close to the band gap, which in turn requires a negative-electron-affinity (NEA) coating consisting of caesium (Cs) and either oxygen or nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). This layer limits the possible operation time of the electron source as the layer deteriorates over time due to interactions with residual gas particles, with contamination through desorption and degradiation through ionized particles hitting the surface being the two main mechanisms. The latter is called ion back-bombardment (IBB) and is the main lifetime-limiting factor during high-current electron emission. Therefore, a reduction of IBB in order to increase operational lifetime and performance of electron sources is of great interest for many accelerator-based applications with polarized electrons. In this dissertation the design, assembly and first experimental results of a new kind of electron source is presented, which aims at reducing IBB by placing the cathode inside an almost closed cryogenic sub-volume. The inner walls of this volume are coated with activated charcoal making them act as a cryopump, reducing the local pressure significantly. The closed design limits the flux of particles from the outer, higher vacuum into the volume. Simulations of the hydrogen partial pressure, which contributes the most to IBB, shows a reduction of up to two magnitudes compared to conventional sources. As IBB intensity directly scales with the amount of residual gas molecules, a significant increase in lifetime can is anticipated. In addition, the cooling of the cathode itself compensates the heat load deposited by the laser beam, hence reducing heat-induced desorption of the NEA layer that would otherwise severely limit cathode lifetime for high-current applications. A pressure below 1 ⋅ 10^-11 mbar outside the sub-volume could be achieved after a four-week bake-out at 120 °C inside an aluminum vacuum chamber equipped with a 45 l/s ion-getter pump and four 430 l/s non-evaporable getter panels. Electrostatic field simulations for electrode voltages ranging from -5 kV to -30 kV have been conducted, showing a maximum field gradient of 11.1(1) MV/m at -30 kV. Experimentally, a stable voltage of -12 kV without and -14 kV with cooling of the electrode has be achieved. Simulations of the electron beam at potentials from -12 kV to -30 kV showed no beam loss for currents from 10 µA to 1 mA. The required cooling power was provided by a 1.1 W closed-cycle cryostat. A temperature of 21.3(1) K at the far end of the sub-volume has be reached allowing an effective pumping of hydrogen. A dedicated test stand was designed and setup at the Institut für Kernphysik of the Technische Universität Darmstadt to conduct measurements evaluating a potential lifetime enhancing effect. It does not feature a chamber to conduct the process of applying the NEA layer to the photocathode surface, also called photocathode activation, hence requiring the use of the existing test stand for Photo-Cathode Activation, Testing, and Cleaning using atomic Hydrogen (Photo-CATCH) for the cleaning and activation procedure. A measurement series demonstrated that a transport chamber, equipped with a NEG pump, is capable of retaining enough of the NEA layer, to allow a transfer of activated cathode from Photo-Catch to the new electron source. After transferring and storing for 20 h a quantum efficiency (QE) of up to 67 % using a re laser with 780 nm and 99 % with a blue 450 nm laser could be maintained. For a foreseen integration of the source into Photo-CATCH, simulations show that with minor modifications of the beamline an operation of both the cryogenic and the conventional source, already in place, is possible. A measurement demonstrating a life time enhancing effect could not be conducted, as the beam was lost at an unknown location in the system. Multiple approaches were conducted to identify the origin of the beam loss, offering room for further exploration.","2023","2023-11-03 07:53:14","2024-12-11 03:58:38","2023-11-03 07:53:14","","162","","","","","","","","","","Technische Universität Darmstadt","Darmstadt","en","Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0 International","Doctoral dissertation","","","","","DOI:10.26083/TUPRINTS-00023275 university-catalog-url: https://tuprints.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/23275/ fulltext-url: https://tuprints.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/23275/1/Dissertation_Tobias_Eggert.pdf","","","","#university/tu-darmstadt; #gender/male","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Durch die Implementierung eines Weglängenanpassungssystems, das eine 360?-Phasenverschiebung ermöglicht, kann der Beschleuniger als Energy-Recovery-LINAC (ERL) betrieben werden. Der mehrfach rezirkulierende (multi-turn) ERL-Betrieb wurde im Jahr 2021 demonstriert. Beim Betrieb des Beschleunigers in diesem Modus gibt es zwei Strahlen in derselben Strahlführung, den einfach beschleunigten und den bereits einfach abgebremsten Strahl, mit einer longitudinalen Phasendifferenz von 180? und möglicherweise deutlich abweichenden Transversalpositionen. Eine Messung dieser Strahlpositionen muss zwangsweise nicht-destruktiv erfolgen, sonst kann der Betriebsmodus nicht aufrechterhalten werden. In dieser Arbeit wurden zwei Messsysteme entwickelt und konstruiert, die beide den notwendigen Anspruch der nicht-Destruktivität erfüllen und darüber hinaus bei Strahlströmen von 100 nA und weniger, wie sie beim Strahleinstellen genutzt werden, verwendet werden können. Als erste Messmethode wurde ein Hochfrequenz (HF)-Positionsmonitor mit einer Resonanzfrequenz von 6 GHz, die der doppelten Betriebsfrequenz des S-DALINAC entspricht, entworfen und dessen geometrische Kenngrößen durch Simulationen bestimmt. Der Monitor wurde so designt, dass er zwei Zellen besitzt, jeweils eine dedizierte Zelle für die Messung der horizontalen und vertikalen Strahlposition. Auf Basis der simulierten Geometrieparameter wurde der Monitor konstruiert und anschließend Frequenz und Kopplung abgestimmt. Im Rahmen einer Kommissionierungsmessung konnte erfolgreich eine Abhängigkeit der Signalstärke von der Vertikalposition des einfach abgebremsten Strahls gemessen werden. Weiterhin konnte eine Kalibrationsmessung mit dem einfach beschleunigten Strahl durchgeführt werden, wobei die Positionsgenauigkeit des Monitors abseits der Resonatormitte zu 30 𝜇m für die vertikale Position und 50 𝜇m für die horizontale Position bestimmt wurde. Als zweite Messmethode wurde ein Drahtscanner konstruiert, bei dem zwei Wolframdrähte mit jeweils einem Radius von 50 𝜇m durch den Strahl gefahren werden und die so verursachte Sekundärteilchenrate detektiert werden kann. Eine spezielle Datenaufnahme ermöglicht Datenraten von bis zu 420 Hz. Dadurch war es möglich eine auf dem Strahl liegende 50 Hz-Störung genauer zu untersuchen. Der Drahtscanner wurde erfolgreich dazu verwendet die Strahlpositionen beider Strahlen im multi-turn ERL-Betrieb zu messen. Dabei wurde eine Messgenauigkeit der Position von etwa 100 𝜇m erreicht. In der Gegenüberstellung beider Messmethoden zeigt sich, dass der HF-Monitor einen höheren Auslegungs-, Fertigungs- und Kalibrationsaufwand erfordert. Allerdings stellt er am S-DALINAC zurzeit die einzige Möglichkeit dar, die Strahlposition nicht-destruktiv und dauerhaft zu messen. Der Drahtscanner weist eine einfachere Handhabung auf und zeigt eine höhere Zeitauflösung, allerdings ist die Messdauer von bis zu 30 Sekunden zu lang, um ihn beim Einstellen des Strahls effizient verwenden zu können.","2024-08","2024-12-09 22:08:00","2024-12-09 22:45:01","","","","","","","","","","","","","Technische Universität Darmstadt","","en","","Doctoral dissertation","","","","","DOI: https://doi.org/10.26083/tuprints-00027838 Pages: x, 87 Seiten","","","","#university/tu-darmstadt; #facility/s-dalinac","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this purpose, multiple experiments at the {\ensuremath{\gamma}}? setup and clover array setup at the High-Intensity {\ensuremath{\gamma}}-ray Source (HI{\ensuremath{\gamma}}S) at Duke University and at the Darmstadt High-Intensity Photon Setup (DHIPS) of the superconducting Darmstadt electron linear accelerator (S-DALINAC) at Technische Universit{\""a}t Darmstadt were performed. For the ?{$^5$}{$^0$}Nd experiment at HI{\ensuremath{\gamma}}S, the laser-Compton backscattering photon beam was operated in a new high-resolution mode, with an energy resolution of {\ensuremath{\Delta}}E/E {$\approx$}â€¯2â€¯\%. The high energy resolution allowed, for the first time, the spectral separation of different decay components into the ground state band for a heavy deformed nucleus. Between 4â€¯MeV and 7â€¯MeV, an almost constant average branching ratio of 0.481(71) between the decay to the 2{$^+$}{$_1$} state and the ground state was observed. By introducing an internal fluctuation ratio s, the statistical distribution of partial transition widths was deduced. The observations are consistent with {\ensuremath{\chi}}?-distributed transition widths with degree of freedom {\ensuremath{\nu}}â€¯=â€¯1.82(10), and inconsistent with the Porter-Thomas distribution {\ensuremath{\nu}}â€¯=â€¯1. Additionally, in combination with the DHIPS experiment, properties of individual states and the photon-scattering cross section were determined. For the {$^9$}{$^6$}Mo experiment, utilizing {\ensuremath{\gamma}}{\ensuremath{\gamma}}-coincidence measurements in combination with a linearly polarized quasi-monochromatic photon beam, the photon strength functions (PSFs) were determined that are built on top of excited 2{$^+$} states, which were then combined into a single downward PSF. The general shape and slope of the determined PSF agree very well with experiments using complementary probes, however, it is much smoother and exhibits fewer fluctuations in comparison to the literature values. This deviation indicates a possible violation of the Brink-Axel hypothesis for the studied energy range.}","2024-07","2024-12-09 22:08:00","2024-12-11 03:35:35","","","","","","","","","","","","","Technische Universität Darmstadt","","en","","Doctoral dissertation","","","","","DOI: https://doi.org/10.26083/tuprints-00011437 Pages: xx, 176 Seiten","","","","#university/tu-darmstadt; #gender/male; #facility/s-dalinac/dhips","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the main challenges of this field is the investigation of exotic nuclei, which are characterized by a large excess of neutrons or protons, and are located far from the stability line. To carry out this investigation, experimental techniques capable of producing and detecting these exotic nuclei are required. At the GSI Helmholtzzentrum für Schwerionenforschung in Germany, the DESPEC setup has been utilized to conduct important nuclear structure studies on exotic nuclei. This setup, in combination with the high-intensity primary beams available at GSI, has provided significant opportunities for the investigation of these exotic nuclei. In March 2021, an experiment was conducted at GSI where isotopes of interest were generated through the fragmentation of a primary ?⁰⁸Pb beam with an energy of 1 GeV/u directed at a ⁹Be target. The final products were then identified on an event-by-event basis in the FRS based on their proton number (Z) and mass-to-charge ratio (A/Q), and they were implanted in the DESPEC setup. To further investigate the nuclear structure of these exotic nuclei, measuring the lifetime of excited nuclear states was performed. The measurement was carried out using 36 ultra-fast LaBr₃(Ce) detectors from the FATIMA setup. This setup, through a fast-timing technique, enables the hard-to-reach short-lifetime values of those excited states. This work presents a new isomeric lifetime measurement for ?⁹⁰W. Additionally, we obtained the lifetime of the first 2⁺ state of ?⁹⁰W for the first time using the generalized centroid difference method. In view of the systematic behavior of the R₄₂ , B₂₂ , and B(E2) values, the known spectroscopic data on ?⁹⁰W matches the predictions for γ-softness. These experimental results have been compared to new theoretical calculations obtained within the interacting boson model (IBM-2). Both experimental and theoretical results agree that the known spectroscopic data on ?⁹⁰W matches the predictions for the most γ-soft, O(6)-like isotope in the tungsten isotopic chain, approaching the N=126 shell closure. Overall, our study provides new insights into the nuclear structure of exotic nuclei and highlights the importance of advanced experimental techniques in this field.","2023","2024-12-09 22:08:00","2024-12-09 22:38:57","","","","","","","","","","","","","Technische Universität Darmstadt","","en","","Doctoral dissertation","","","","","DOI: https://doi.org/10.26083/tuprints-00024403 Pages: ix, 147 Seiten","","","","#university/tu-darmstadt","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(e,e'γ) reactions are characterized by the pure electromagnetic interaction in the excitation and in the decay channels and thereby allow nuclear physics investigations with high precision. In contrast to inclusive electron scattering, this measurement method is directly sensitive to the interference of longitudinal and transverse form factors, which affects the angular distribution of the emitted photons. To establish the new (e,e?γ) setup, the existing large acceptance QCLAM electron spectrometer was combined with a new setup consisting of LaBr_3:Ce detectors. For the readout of the γ-ray detectors, a new data acquisition system was developed and combined with the existing QCLAM data acquisition system to form a coincidence data acquisition. A software package for data analysis was developed. In the first commissioning experiment on the 2_1^+ and 1_2^+ states of 12C, the functionality of the (e,e'γ)-setup could be demonstrated. Findings from this and from a second commissioning experiment on 96Ru, together with GEANT4 simulations, were used to optimize the setup with a particular focus on the reduction of background radiation in the γ-ray detectors. The full and optimized setup was used in a first production run on a 96Ru target to measure the γ-decay behavior below and above the neutron separation threshold. Isolated states were observed to decay via the 2_1^+ state of 96Ru. Above the neutron separation threshold, 96Ru decays by emission of a neutron to 95Ru.

While the atoms are produced in a wide range of highly excited Rydberg states, experiments rely on ground state antihydrogen which are currently obtained only via spontaneous emission. Due to radiative lifetimes of the order of milliseconds, the decay toward ground state is slow. Magnetic neutral-atom traps allow to hold onto the initially formed antihydrogen. Here, ground state atoms are obtained via spontaneous decay along the trapping potential and spectroscopy measurements can be performed inside the trap. Typical traps capture maximum temperatures (for ground state atoms) of roughly 500mK. State-of-the-art formation temperatures, however, lie around 40K. Due to the large difference between formation and trappable temperature, currently best achieved trapping fractions of antihydrogen amount to only 0.01%. As an alternative, the formed anti-atoms can be extracted out of their formation region into a beam allowing for close to field-free measurements. At the given velocities, the Rydberg radiative decay toward ground state is too slow to establish a significant population of the ground state through spontaneous emission even within a few meter long beam path. In addition, an efficient beam formation would require antihydrogen in ground state close to the formation region. This work thus deals with the controlled manipulation of Rydberg atoms to stimulate their decay toward ground state. In order to address the initial distribution of Rydberg levels with deexcitation lasers, state-mixing can be achieved through pulsed electric fields that are added to the already present magnetic one in state-of-the-art formation traps. Another possibility lies in mixing the states with light in the THz and microwave frequency range. In both cases, visible lasers allow to very efficiently transfer the mixed population toward the ground state via intermediate strongly bound states that decay on a few nanosecond timescales. In a three-body-recombination reaction the capture of positrons into a bound state of antiprotons can be enhanced relying on stimulated radiative recombination. This approach can be combined with the developed techniques to deexcite bound levels. In trap experiments use-cases of deexcitation for cooling within a magnetic field gradient to enhance the trapping fraction of antihydrogen atoms exist. The second part of the thesis deals with the experimental implementation of the methods theoretically identified in part one. Deexcitation light sources are tested and a hydrogen Rydberg beamline for a proof-of-principle experiment is designed, built and commissioned. Different Rydberg beam production schemes are discussed and experimentally assessed. Rydberg state formation is observed within a microwave discharge plasma and a hydrogen 2s to Rydberg excitation laser is commissioned.","2022","2024-12-09 22:08:00","2024-12-09 22:38:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","Technische Universität Darmstadt","","en","","Doctoral dissertation","","","","","DOI: https://doi.org/10.26083/tuprints-00020310 Pages: xiv, 147 Seiten","","","","#university/tu-darmstadt","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Still, selected properties can often be modeled by macroscopic equilibrium shapes. Their evolution with nucleon number exhibits all signs of phase-transitional behavior. A prominent example for a transition between spherical and axially-symmetric deformed phases is the region of the nuclear chart in the vicinity of N = 90. It is characterized by a rapid onset of deformation with neutron number which is discernible from a multitude of observables such as isomer shifts, excitation energies, and transition strengths. Mixed-symmetry states ? states with nontrivial symmetry properties regarding their proton and neutron subsystems ? have proven their sensitivity to the underlying shell structure as well as shape evolution across quantum phase transitions. Especially the electromagnetic transitions between the 1+ scissors mode and the 0+2 state are strongly affected by the amount of nuclear deformation. In this work, the elusive E2 properties of mixed-symmetry states are established as novel signatures for phase- transitional behavior. This includes their extraction for the transitional nucleus 154Gd and the quadrupole deformed nuclei 162,164Dy using the method of nuclear resonance fluorescence at the High-Intensity γ-ray Source in Durham, NC, USA in connection with calculations in the proton-neutron version of the algebraic Interacting Boson Model. Precision values for the branching ratios between the scissors mode and the 2+1 state of 164Dy uncover significant deviations from the Alaga predictions for K = 1 states. From a two-state mixing calculation, the K- mixing matrix element along with first information on ?K = 0 M1 excitation strength is obtained. The latter is about two orders of magnitude smaller than usual collective ?K = 1 M1 strengths. This mixing is caused by the Coriolis interaction. It represents a first-order perturbation of a Hamiltonian which is diagonal in K. The associated mixing matrix element is twice as large as the one obtained from the second-order effect which admixes ground and γ bands.","2021","2024-12-09 22:08:00","2024-12-09 22:45:07","","","","","","","","","","","","","Technische Universität Darmstadt","","en","","Doctoral dissertation","","","","","DOI: https://doi.org/10.26083/tuprints-00019255 Pages: xii, 171 Seiten","","","","#university/tu-darmstadt","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"P4Y7SQ8B","thesis","2021","Kern, Ralph","Isovector one-quadrupole-phonon excitations of heavy vibrational nuclei","","","","","http://tubiblio.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/126963/","The investigation and identification of mixed-symmetry states stand in the focus of this work. They are formed from collective vibrations and rotations of valence neutrons and protons, where the two nucleon groups oscillate partly out-of-phase with respect to each other. In vibrational nuclei, the $2^+_\mathrm{1,ms}$ state is the lowest-lying mixed-symmetry level. For the $N=80$ isotones, the sub-shell closure at $Z=58$ highly effects the structure of the $2^+_\mathrm{1,ms}$ state. Up to $Z=56$, the isotones have isolated $2^+_\mathrm{1,ms}$ states, but for $^{138}$Ce ($Z=58$), it is strongly fragmented. This behaviour is explained by the valence-shell stabilization, which is lacking at the proton sub-shell closure $Z=58$. For addressing the question how the $2^+_\mathrm{1,ms}$ state behaves while going beyond the proton sub-shell closure, projectile Coulomb-excitation experiments were performed. They took place at HIE-ISOLDE at CERN using the $\gamma$-ray spectrometer Miniball with the radioactive ion beams of the $N=80$ isotones $^{140}$Nd and $^{142}$Sm. The enhanced $B(M1;2^+_3\to2^+_1)=0.26^{+0.11}_{-0.10}\,\mu_\mathrm{N}^2$ strength and the low upper limit $B(M1;2^+_4\to2^+_1)¡0.04\,\mu_\mathrm{N}^2$ of $^{140}$Nd showed the restoration of the valence-shell stabilization at $Z=60$. From the $M1$ strength distribution, the quality of the $F$ spin of $^{140}$Nd was determined by the $F$-spin mixing matrix element $V_\mathrm{F-mix}¡7^{+13}_{-7}\,\mathrm{keV}$. The reduced mixing matrix element supports the proposed restoration of the valence-shell stabilization. For $^{142}$Sm, the Coulomb-excitation analysis delivered an upper limit $B(M1;2^+_3\to2^+_1)¡0.14^{+0.37}_{-0.01}\,\mu_\mathrm{N}^2$, which is not in conflict with the conclusions from the $^{140}$Nd experiment. A complementary $\gamma$-$\gamma$ correlation measurement after $\beta^+$/$\epsilon$ decay to determine the indispensable $E2$/$M1$ multipole-mixing ratio $\delta$ of the $2^+_3\to2^+_1$ transition of $^{142}$Sm was designed for the Heavy Ion Laboratory in Warsaw and accepted. For the stable $^{202}$Hg, a projectile Coulomb-excitation experiment was conducted at the ATLAS facility at the ANL using the $\gamma$-ray spectrometer Gammasphere. Simultaneously, angular particle-$\gamma$ correlations were measured with the aim of deducing $\delta$. In $^{202}$Hg a pronounced $B(M1;2^+_7\to2^+_1)=0.18(8) \,\mu_\mathrm{N}^2$ with $\delta=0.06(4)$ was found, while an upper limit for the neighboring transition was obtained, $B(M1;2^+_8\to2^+_1)¡0.027 \,\mu_\mathrm{N}^2$. For the first time in the mass region $A\approx200$, the $F$-spin mixing quality was determined, for $^{202}$Hg and $^{204}$Hg, $V_\mathrm{F-mix}=9(2)^{+3}_{-3}\,\mathrm{keV}$ and $11(1)^{+4}_{-5}\,\mathrm{keV}$, respectively. Consequently, $F$ spin can be considered a sufficiently good approximate quantum number in the investigated nuclei of $N,Z=80$ near doubly-magic isotopes.","2021","2024-12-09 22:08:00","2024-12-10 07:58:30","","","195","","","","","","","","","","Technische Universität Darmstadt","","en","","Doctoral dissertation","","","","","DOI: 10.26083/tuprints-00018581","","","","#university/tu-darmstadt","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These nuclei are of great interest, due to their unique position at the lower end of the medium heavy nuclei and with regards to magic nucleon number. They were investigated with the nuclear resonance fluorescence method at the accelerator facilities of the Darmstadt super-conducting electron accelerator S-DALINAC and the high-intensity γ-ray source HIγS. Numerous excited states were observed, many of those for the first time. Spin and parity quantum numbers as well as transition strengths were determined for these states. This enables the photoresponse to be distinguished between electric and magnetic dipole strength distribution. Therefore, it is possible to analyze the behavior of known modes, such as the scissors mode, the spin-flip resonance and in particular the pygmy dipole resonance, across a shell closure. In order to do so, the interpretation of the obtained data is supported by calculations within the nuclear shell model and the relativistic mean-field model.","2020-07","2024-12-09 22:08:00","2024-12-09 22:44:41","","","","","","","","","","","","","Technische Universität Darmstadt","","en","","Doctoral dissertation","","","","","DOI: https://doi.org/10.25534/tuprints-00011909","","","","#university/tu-darmstadt","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Information on the mean lifetimes of nuclear excited states can give insight into the evolution of the nuclear shape as a function of nucleon number. For this work, mean lifetimes of the rare-earth isotopes 174,176,178,180Hf and 152Gd have been measured. The mean lifetimes have been determined with the fast-timing technique, already introduced in the 1950s, but applicable to a wider range of excited nuclear states, due to rapid progress in the development of new scintillation detectors in the last two decades. Both experiments have been performed at the FN Tandem accelerator of the IFIN-HH with the ROSPHERE detector array. A possible new signature for the known quantum phase transition at N=90 has been established with the results from the 152Gd experiment and the correlation to other observables, such as the E0 transition strength, has been investigated. The evolution of collectivity and the rotational structure of the hafnium isotopes have been investigated and a maximum of the collectivity at N=100 has been identified. In total 13 mean lifetimes have been determined for the 174,176,178,180Hf isotopes. The nuclear magnetic dipole moment is an important indicator of the composition of the proton neutron wave function, and therefore the single particle properties of the nuclear state. The second part of this thesis presents the results from a g-factor measurement of the 2+1 state of 18O with the recently developed ECR-TDRIV technique. The method is in particular foreseen for the application to radioactive ion beams, but has to be tested with stable beams.

Furthermore, since the decay rate for 0νββ decay is directly related to the effective mass of the electron neutrino, it would allow for a direct determination of the neutrino mass. However, an obstacle for the planning of future 0νββ-decay searches and for a quantitative extraction of the neutrino mass are currently the poorly constrained nuclear matrix elements which mediate the decay process. These matrix elements have the be supplied by nuclear theory, which is challenged with the phenomena of nuclear shape evolution and shape coexistence that prevail in regions of the nuclear chart where most 0νββ-decay candidates are located. A major problem is the lack of sensitive experimental data, which are required to fix the parameters of effective theories. Based on a previous successful study, the nuclear structure of the candidate pairs 82Se/82Kr and 150Nd/150Sm was investigated in this work using the method of nuclear resonance fluorescence. The observables of interest were the decay channels of a low-lying collective nuclear excitation, the scissors mode, which are expected to be highly sensitive to the location of the candidate pairs in the phase diagram of nuclear shapes. The scissors mode can be studied selectively and with a high degree of model indepedence with the chosen method. The experiments were performed at the High-Intensity Gamma-Ray Source which currently provides the most intense, linearly polarized, quasi-monochromatic photon beam at the energies of interest. Using the high sensitivity of the polarized beam, magnetic dipole excitations, which are the manifestations of the scissors mode in even-even nuclei, were identified and their decay behavior was characterized. A known drawback of experiments with monoenergetic photon beams, namely the lack of a photon-flux calibration, was solved in the present work without any additional instrumentation by calibrating the flux on the nonresonant scattering of photons on the targets. For this purpose, a detailed Monte-Carlo particle simulation application was developed. For all nuclei of interest, decay branches on the order of few percent could either be observed, or constrained to such small values. Two effective nuclear models, the shell model and the interacting boson model, which are also frequently used to predict 0νββ decay matrix elements, were used for a preliminary interpretation of the data. For the nucleus 82Se, the shell model gave a good description of the energies of excited 1+ states and the total observed strength. The good agreement allowed for an interpretation of the structure of the wave functions of the scissors mode candidates, which advised against a simple relation between the measured quantities and the shape coexistence in that nucleus. For the higher-mass isotopes, a careful parameter adjustment in the framework of the interacting boson model was able to reproduce the entire low-energy structure of 150Nd and, with minor exceptions also of 150Sm. The new parameter sets in this model were used together with our collaborator to update previous predictions of nuclear matrix elements for 0νββ decay. Note that the analysis of the data on the A=150 nuclei was done by Jörn Kleemann. This work presents only his main results.","2020-01","2024-12-09 22:08:00","2024-12-09 22:45:00","","","","","","","","","","","","","Technische Universität Darmstadt","","en","","Doctoral dissertation","","","","","DOI: https://doi.org/10.25534/tuprints-00011385","","","","#university/tu-darmstadt","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The infrastructure of the QCLAM spectrometer provides a set of basic conditions for the design. Difficulties in handling liquid helium provide further challenges. After the delivery of the required components, the cryostat had to be assembled and tested. The development of a suitable cooling procedure was a particularly critical point. The functionality of the cryostat was demonstrated in a following experiment. The assumed advantages of superfluid helium instead of liquid helium at boiling temperature as target material were confirmed. A commissioning experiment at the QCLAM spectrometer was performed. By evaluating the spectrum of elastically scattered electrons, the target thickness could be measured experimentally. It agrees with the geometric manufacturer's specifications.

Letzteres konnte nur über den Photoabsorptionswirkungsquerschnitt ermittelt werden, aus dem noch weitere physikalische Größen wie die elektrische Dipolstärke und die Gamma-Stärkefunktion berechnet worden sind. Das Streuexperiment wurde 2010 am Research Center for Nuclear Physics in Osaka, Japan, mit einer Einschussenergie von Ep=295MeV durchgeführt. Die Impulshöhenspektren wurden in einen doppelt differentiellenWirkungsquerschnitt umgerechnet, um aus diesem die einzelnen Multipolbeiträge mittels einer Multipolentfaltung zu extrahieren. Im Rahmen der Multipolentfaltung konnte gezeigt werden, dass sich der Beitrag der effektiven Ladung in den Modellwinkelverteilungen des E1-Multipolanteils negativ auf deren Ergebnis auswirkt und Modellwinkelverteilungen ohne den Anteil der effektiven Ladung zu bevorzugen sind. Von den extrahierten Multipolanteilen wurden aus den beiden am stärksten auftretenden Multipolanteilen E1 und M1 physikalisch relevante Größen generiert. Für den M1-Multipolanteil sind die reduzierte Übergangsstärke B(M1) und ihre Gesamtstärke im Energiebereich von (6-14)MeV bestimmt und mit (gamma,gamma?)-Daten verglichen worden. Weiterhin konnten aus der B(M1)-Stärke und dem E1- Multipolanteil Photoabsorptionswirkungsquerschnitte gebildet werden, wobei letzteres mit Hilfe der Virtuelle-Photonen-Methode umgesetzt wurde. Beide Anteile am Photoabsorptionswirkungsquerschnitt konnten so untereinander und in ihrer Summe mit (gamma,x)-Daten verglichen werden.

A first-order QSPT exists in the transition from spherical shapes to the axially symmetric deformed shapes. There are models describing even-even nuclei in terms of their shape and their oscillations and rotations symmetries, such us the U(5) symmetry (for spherical shapes - vibrator) and SU(3) symmetry (for axially symmetric deformed shapes - rotor). Along the QSPT the spherical minimum, corresponding to a spherical shape, starts vanishing and the deformed one, corresponding to a deformed shape, appears. While the nuclear potentials of a vibrator and a symmetric rotor have one minimum, the potential of a nucleus near the critical point (CP) of the first-order QSPT between them presents the two competing minima. The X(5) model provides some signatures of the isotopes at the CP. A first-order QSPT is known in the even-even N=90 isotones with Z=60?66. With Z=58, 148Ce lies in the low-Z boundary of this transition from spherical to axially symmetric deformed shapes. This nucleus is studied in this work. Key observables revealing the nuclear shape, such as the energy ratio R4/2=E(4+1)/E(2+1) and the transition strength ratio B4/2=B(E2;4+1→2+1)/B(E2;2+1→0+1), are compared with the predictions from models describing nuclei along this transition and specially near the CP. The experimental analysis to obtain the lifetimes of the first 2+ and first 4+ states of 148Ce using fast-timing techniques is shown in this work. The data were taken within the EXILL&FATIMA campaign performed at the high-flux reactor of the Institut Laue-Langevin in Grenoble, where fission fragments of 235U and 241Pu were measured by a hybrid spectrometer, consisting of high-resolution germanium and fast-responding lanthanum bromide scintillator detectors. The measurement of the lifetime of the first 4 + state of 148 Ce allows the calculation of the B4/2 observable and contributes in the study of the shape of the nucleus. Beside the comparison with the models, the whole N ≈ 90 region is being investigated within the interacting boson model. The shape evolution of the cerium, the neodymium and the samarium chains is studied and shows the importance of the increasing axially asymmetry.","2019","2024-12-09 22:08:00","2024-12-09 22:44:53","","","","","","","","","","","","","Technische Universität Darmstadt","","en","","Doctoral dissertation","","","","","","","","","#university/tu-darmstadt","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such scenarios arose in an experimental benchmark test of the so-called Coulex-multipolarimetry, as well as in a first simulation-based approach to potential competitive double γ-decay experiments with the Advanced GAmma Tracking Array AGATA. The first benchmark of the Coulex-multipolarimetry was performed during the PreSPEC campaign at the GSI Helmholtzzentrum für Schwerionenforschung in 2014 to identify the potential πp3/2 → πp1/2 spin-flip transition in the neutron- rich 85Br via measurement of the E2/M1 multipole mixing ratio δ. The achieved performance of said first benchmark test is presented using standard methods of γ-spectroscopy as well as γ-ray tracking and derived methods. The competitive double γ decay, measured for the first time in 137Ba in 2015 via LaBr3(Ce) detectors, is a potential source for new information about nuclear structure. Since angular and energy correlations between the emitted γ rays are one of the main sources of said information, AGATA with its high angular and energy resolution appears to be predestined for this task. Due to its comparatively small time resolution capabilities, a successful distinction between single and double γ-decay events, however, has to fully rely on γ-ray tracking techniques. Whether such measurements of the double γ decay with AGATA are feasible is verified in this work based on simulations. Novel insights into γ-ray tracking which arose during the analysis resulted in the development of a novel γ-ray tracking algorithm, called ExpTrack , based on experimentally achieved Compton-scattering angles. This new approach is also presented in this work.","2019","2024-12-09 22:08:00","2024-12-09 22:44:46","","","","","","","","","","","","","Technische Universität Darmstadt","","en","","Doctoral dissertation","","","","","DOI: https://doi.org/10.25534/tuprints-00009673","","","","#university/tu-darmstadt","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This work quantifies the sudden onset of quadrupole collectivity at the transitional nucleus 98Zr. As measure for quadrupole collectivity, the first-time determination of the B(E2;2+ -¿ 0+g.s.) transition strength value of 98Zr was performed: A Coulomb excitation experiment with a radioactive 98Zr ion beam at the Argonne National Laboratory (USA) yielded a decisively small upper limit for the transition strength of interest. Complementary, the respective lifetime of the 2+1 level was measured with the RDDS method employing a 96Zr(18O, 16O)98Zr two-neutron transfer reaction at IFIN-HH (Romania). The analysis of the two independent experiments is described and the results combined and discussed. The findings are compared to recent theory and confirm the predicted shape coexistence in 98Zr as effect of type-II shell evolution.

The experiment was conducted in March 2015 at the Radioactive Ion Beam Factory of the RIKEN Nishina Center (RIBF-RIKEN) located in Japan. A radioactive beam of exotic nuclei was delivered by the BigRIPS fragment separator, tuned to select the desired products of the in-flight fission of a 238U primary beam on a Be target. This secondary beam impinged on a liquid Hydrogen (LH2) target, producing Selenium nuclei via different nucleon knock-out reactions. The final products passed through the ZeroDegree mass spectrometer, where they were identified on an event-by-event basis by means of determination of the proton number (Z) and mass-to-charge ratio (A/Q), and were finally implanted into a stack of silicon layers of the AIDA detector system. The existence and subsequent decay of isomeric excited states of these nuclei was studied with the EURICA gamma-ray HPGe detector placed around the AIDA layers. New spectroscopic information has been obtained for both isotopes, leading to an extension of their level schemes. In particular, the isomeric state of 94 Se has been observed for the first time. The possible causes of isomerism in these nuclei have been discussed and compared with the results, and it has been found that the presence of oblate-deformed quasi-particle states play an important role in the description of the isomerism phenomenon. The level schemes obtained have been compared with the predictions of different state-of-the-art beyond mean-field calculations, which propose all a prolate-to-oblate shape transition with increasing neutron number taking place between N=56 and N=60 (90,92,94 Se).

The experimental setup and the data analysis are described in detail. This analysis includes necessary functionality checks and calibrations of the detectors along the beam line. In-flight γ-ray spectroscopy of 84,86,88Ge was performed after various knock-out reactions. γ-spectroscopy of neutron-rich 88Ge was performed for the first time. The Doppler-corrected γ-ray spectra are analyzed with simulated lineshapes of occurring transitions. In total 16 transitions are observed ten of which so far unknown. New level schemes for 86,88 Ge are proposed based on the observed transition intensities and systematics of neighboring Ge isotopes. The obtained level schemes are compared to state-of-the-art theoretical calculations. The assignment of a 3⁺ state of 86Ge agrees with new shell model and SCCM predictions. The agreement to the level orderings from the collective model by Davydov and co-workers points to an amount of rigid triaxiality in 86Ge. This is the first indication of rigid triaxiality in an unstable, neutron-rich nucleus. In addition, an analysis of reaction cross sections, as well as cross sections for the excitation of a particular state is performed. This data set represents one of the first results for this newly-accessible region of the nuclear chart. Furthermore, 84,86Ge and 94,96Kr are investigated after (p,p') reactions, which excite different states than the knock-out reactions. These states are candidates for octupole 3⁻ states, which are the first benchmark for the octupole degree of freedom in this exotic region. The obtained (p,p') cross sections of the 2⁺₁ states from 94,96Kr are compared to the transition strength known from literature based on the deformation length.","2018","2024-12-09 22:08:00","2024-12-09 22:44:50","","","","","","","","","","","","","Technische Universität Darmstadt","","en","","Doctoral dissertation","","","","","","","","","#university/tu-darmstadt","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the past, pioneering experiments have been done in the RISING campaign at GSI. The PreSPEC-AGATA setup has been the next step in the evolution of this type of experiments, with better and more complex instrumentation, leading to higher sensitivity and resolution. This work is relevant for for the preparation of the even more demanding future HISPEC setup at the upcoming FAIR facility. HISPEC experiments will study low-lying excited states of nuclei far from stability, in order to test the validity of nuclear structure models in that area of the nuclear chart. More complex instrumentation results in more complex data analysis programs. In order to deal with the complexity involved in developing such software for the upcoming experiments, a more systematic approach to the development process is needed. Within this work, a software framework was developed to facilitate a systematic and clean software design. This might be helpful for upcoming NUSTAR experiments at FAIR, where a large number of independent detector systems have to be integrated into a big setup. The design of the framework is discussed in the second chapter of this thesis. One important reaction mechanism for the HISPEC experiments is Coulomb excitation at energies of around 150 MeV/u. Because of the purely electromagnetic nature of the interaction, Coulomb excitation is described well by theoretical models. In the third chapter of this thesis, a numerical simulation program for relativistic ion-ion collisions was developed that solves the coupled channel equations for electric Coulomb excitation. In the fourth chapter, the relevant detector systems of the PreSPEC setup are presented, and the calibration of them is discussed. A main aspect of the work was the development of improved ways to analyze data from these devices, and, if possible to provide semi-automatic implementations for their calibration. In the last chapter, the total efficiency of the PreSPEC-setup was determined for a typical Coulomb excitation experiment, and the possibility to measure projectile excitation cross-sections relative to a target excitation cross-section is demonstrated.","2018","2024-12-09 22:08:00","2024-12-09 22:44:43","","","","","","","","","","","","","Technische Universität Darmstadt","","en","","Doctoral dissertation","","","","","","","","","#university/tu-darmstadt","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Collective quadrupole excitations of symmetric and mixed-symmetric character allow for investigating the underlying microscopic nuclear structure as well as the effective proton-neutron interaction. Isovector valence-shell excitations are distinct especially near shell closures. The N = 80 isotones around the doubly-magic nucleus Sn-132 and the region around the doubly-magic nucleus Pb-208 are of particular interest. Projectile Coulomb-excitation experiments on the radioactive nucleus Sm-142 and the stable nuclei Hg-202 and Hg-204 were performed in order to further our understanding of nuclear structure in these regions. The decay strength of the first excited state of Sm-142 is determined to B(E2;2_1^+ -¿ 0_1^+) = 32 (4) W.u. It is a foundation for the investigation of a possible restoration of shell stabilization in N = 80 isotones above the Z = 58 subshell closure. The 2_1,ms^+ state of Po-212 has recently been identified. The nucleus Hg-204 is the particle-hole conjugate to Po-212 with respect to the doubly-magic nucleus Pb-208. Hg-204 was investigated together with its neighboring even-even isotope Hg-202 for comparison to the situation in Po-212. One quadrupole-phonon mixed-symmetry states are identified in both nuclei, with transition strengths of B(M1;2_7^+ -¿ 2_1^+) = 0.16 (7) ?_N^2 in Hg-202 and B(M1;2_2^+ -¿ 2_1^+) = 0.20 (2)?_N^2 in Hg-204.

Radioactive isotopes were produced by the in-flight fission of a beam of 238U ions incident on a 3 mm thick Beryllium target. After production, neutron-rich radioactive isotopes were selected and identified on an event-by-event basis using the BigRIPS separator. Selected isotopes of interest were focused onto the liquid hydrogen target of the MINOS device and gamma-rays from inelastic (p, p') reactions were detected with the DALI2 array, consisting of 186 NaI crystals. Outgoing beam-like particles were identified using the ZeroDegree spectrometer. Gamma-rays produced in the reaction were Doppler corrected and the first 2+ and 4+ states in all the isotopes were identified. Detailed data analysis was performed including the implementation of algorithms that discriminate events where more than one particle was present. Using detailed Geant4 simulations, exclusive cross-sections for inelastic proton scattering were obtained. Deformation lengths were deduced from the experimental cross-sections using the coupled-channel calculation code ECIS-97. The deformations lengths of 72,74Ni and 76,80Zn were found to be fairly constant at a value of 0.8(2) fm, suggesting similar vibrational amplitudes, while the isomeric presence in the secondary beams of 70Ni and 78Zn allowed only lower limits for those two isotopes. By combining the deformation lengths with the known B(E2; 0+ -¿ 2+) values, the neutron-to-proton matrix element ratios, Mn/Mp, were obtained. A clear indication of the closed proton shell in the 72,74Ni could be observed, as Mn/Mp ¿ N/Z, indicating an increased contribution of the neutrons to the vibrational amplitude.

Die Analysen zielten darauf ab, die statische elektrische Dipol-Polarisierbarkeit für den Bereich der isovektoriellen Dipol-Riesenresonanz (IVGDR) und die totale elektromagnetische M1-Stärke für den prominenten Spin-M1-Übergang bei einer Anregungsenergie von 10,22 MeV zu bestimmen. Die Polarisierbarkeit wurde aus den Protonenstreudaten für den Anregungsenergiebereich von (11-26) MeV extrahiert. Die benötigten E1-Wirkungsquerschnitte gingen aus einer Multipolentfaltung der experimentellen Wirkungsquerschnitte hervor. Mit Hilfe der Methode virtueller Photonen konnten diese in einen analogen Photoabsorptionsquerschnitt umgerechnet werden. Aus der Verteilung der Photoabsorptionsquerschnitte wurde die Polarisierbarkeit berechnet. Die Analyse der (p,p')-Daten hat deutlich gemacht, dass sowohl die Festlegung eines geeigneten maximalen Streuwinkels in der Methode virtueller Photonen und die Methode der Multipolentfaltung im Bereich der IVGDR zu Problemen führen kann. In der Analyse stellte es sich als schwierig heraus, einerseits E1- und M1-Beiträge zum experimentellen Wirkungsquerschnitt auf der niederenergetischen Flanke der Resonanz eindeutig zu trennen und andererseits ein geeignetes Untergrundmodell auf der höherenergetischen Flanke festzulegen. Je nachdem mit welchen Modellwinkelverteilungen der Wirkungsquerschnitte die Multipolentfaltungen durchgeführt wurden, lag das Ergebnis bei (1,36 +/- 0,14) fm? oder (1,50 +/- 0,09) fm?. Mit einem um Protonenemissionen erweiterten 48Ca(e,e'n)-Datensatz und mit 40Ca(gamma,abs)-Daten aus konnte ein Wertebereich für die Polarisierbarkeit des Kerns 48Ca im gleichen Anregungsenergiebereich bestimmt werden. Die Polarisierbarkeit liegt demnach zwischen (1,50 +/- 0,02) fm? und (1,69 +/- 0,03) fm?. Darüber hinaus gibt es sowohl durch die Messung am Kern 40Ca als auch am Kern 48Ca mit polarisierten Protonen Hinweise, dass weitere relevante E1-Stärke bei höheren Anregungsenergien bis zu etwa 60 MeV zu finden ist. Mit den Photoabsorptionsquerschnitten des Kerns 40Ca wurde eine Polarisierbarkeit für den Kern 48Ca im Bereich von (10-60) MeV geschätzt. Sie beträgt (2,09 +/- 0,02) fm? und unterscheidet sich signifikant von einer theoretischen Vorhersage aus der Energiedichte-Funktionaltheorie mit (2,31 +/- 0,09) fm?. Die Ergebnisse der vorliegenden Arbeit können zusammen mit dem entsprechenden Ergebnis für den Kern 208Pb verwendet werden, um die Wertebereiche der Parameter der Kernmodelle weiter einzuschränken. Dazu müssen bestehende Modellrechnungen für den ausgewerteten Anregungsenergiebereich wiederholt werden. Dann können die Ergebnisse der vorliegenden Arbeit einen wichtigen Beitrag zur Bestimmung der Dicke der Neutronenhaut im Kern 48Ca leisten und zur Eingrenzung der Symmetrieenergie-Parameterwerte in der Zustandsgleichung der Kernmaterie. Im Kern 48Ca konzentriert sich nahezu die gesamte experimentell bestimmbare Spin-M1-Stärke in dem \einsplus-Zustand bei 10,22 MeV. Dabei ist der Beitrag zur Spin-M1-Stärke durch das isoskalare Matrixelement im Vergleich zu dem anderen Extremfall, dem Kern 208Pb, maximal. Daher musste in der Analyse ein isoskalarer Beitrag zur Anregung des Zustandes berücksichtigt werden. Die Auswertung der Daten der vorliegenden Arbeit stützte sich auf die für Gamow-Teller-Übergänge etablierte Methode, mit der die hadronische isovektorielle Anregungsstärke aus dem experimentellen Wirkungsquerschnitt bei 0? bestimmt wird. Diese Methode nutzt die Proportionalität zwischen dem Wirkungsquerschnitt und der Anregungsstärke, die für Einschussenergien bei etwa 300 MeV eine geeignete Näherung darstellt. Der Proportionalitätsfaktor ist der sogenannte Einheitsquerschnitt. Diese Methode wurde auf die Anregung von Spin-M1-Übergängen mit Protonen unter den Annahmen übertragen, dass zwischen benachbarten Isobaren Isospinsymmetrie besteht und dass die Einheitsquerschnitte bei der Anregung analoger Zustände gleich sind. Damit war es für den besagten Zustand des Kerns 48Ca möglich, die totale elektromagnetische Spin-M1-Stärke aus dem experimentellen Wirkungsquerschnitt bei 0? zu bestimmen. Dies setzte aber voraus, dass der experimentelle Wirkungsquerschnitt auf seinen isovektoriellen Anteil reduziert werden konnte. Dies war in der vorliegenden Arbeit mit Hilfe einer Entfaltung der experimentellen Wirkungsquerschnitte mit isoskalaren und isovektoriellen Modellwinkelverteilungen aus DWBA-Rechnungen möglich. Zusätzlich boten 48Ca(p,n)-Daten die Möglichkeit, die totale Spin-M1-Stärke des Kerns 48Ca auch aus dem Übergang in den analogen Zustand des Kerns 48Sc zu berechnen. Damit konnte anhand von unabhängigen Daten und einer bereits etablierten Methode überprüft werden, ob die gleiche Methode auch bei (p,p')-Daten sinnvolle Ergebnisse liefert. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurden zusätzlich ältere (p,p')-Daten verwendet, so dass Daten bei 200 MeV und 295 MeV zur Verfügung standen. In allen Fällen waren die Ergebnisse aus den Daten des Kerns 48Ca nicht nur untereinander sondern auch mit dem Elektronenstreuergebnis von B(M1) = (3,9 +/- 0,3) ??_N verträglich. Da diese Methode auch im Fall des Kerns 208Pb(p,p') Ergebnisse lieferte, die in keinem direkten Widerspruch zu den Resultaten aus (gamma,gamma')- und (n,n'gamma)-Messungen standen, wurde das Verfahren als geeignet eingestuft, um die totale Spin-M1-Stärke unter den genannten Bedingungen aus (p,p')-Daten zu extrahieren. Für den diskutierten Zustand des Kerns 48Ca wird ein gewichteter Mittelwert von B(M1) = (3,82 +/- 0,26) ??_N als Ergebnis angegeben. Damit kann das Ergebnis aus einem kürzlich durchgeführten (gamma,n)-Experiment mit B(M1) = (6,8 +/- 0,5) ??_N nicht bestätigt werden.","2016","2024-12-09 22:08:00","2024-12-09 22:45:04","","","","","","","","","","","","","Technische Universität Darmstadt","","en","","Doctoral dissertation","","","","","","","","","Dipolpolarisierbarkeit; Protonenstreuung; #university/tu-darmstadt","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A region of approximate O(6) symmetry for the ground-state band, a partial dynamical symmetry (PDS) of type III, in the parameter space of the extended consistent-Q formalism is identified through quantum number fluctuations. The simultaneous occurrence of a SU(3) quasi dynamical symmetry for nuclei in the region of O(6) PDS is explained via the beta=1, gamma=0 intrinsic state underlying the ground-state band. The previously unrelated concepts of PDS and QDS are connected for the first time and many nuclei in the rare earth region that approximately satisfy both symmetry requirements are identified. Ground-state to ground-state (p,t) transfer reactions are presented as an experimental signature to identify pairs of nuclei that both exhibit O(6) PDS. In the second part of this thesis inelastic electron scattering off 96-Zr is studied. The experiment was performed at the high resolution Lintott spectrometer at the S-DALINAC and covered a momentum-transfer range of 0.28 - 0.59 fm^(-1). Through a relative analysis using Plane Wave Born Approximation (PWBA) the B(E2;2+2-¿0+1) value is extracted without incurring the additional model dependence of a Distorted Wave Born Approximation (DWBA). By combining this result with known multipole mixing ratios and branching ratios all decay strengths of the 2+2 state are determined. A mixing calculation establishes very weak mixing (V = 76 keV) between states of the ground-state band and those of the band build on top of the 0+2 state which includes the 2+2 state. The occurrence of these two isolated bands is interpreted within the shell model in terms of type II shell evolution.","2016","2024-12-09 22:08:00","2024-12-09 22:44:52","","","","","","","","","","","","","Technische Universität Darmstadt","","en","","Doctoral dissertation","","","","","","","","","#university/tu-darmstadt","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These detectors allow to determine the interaction points of γ-ray quanta within the detector material with unrivaled accuracy. The continuous-angle Doppler-Shift Attenuation Method extends the well-known DSA Method for the measurement of nuclear level lifetimes by providing a complete description of the observed characteristic, Doppler-broadened γ-ray lineshapes as a function of the energy and detection polar angle of the γ-rays. The method?s power is demonstrated by the precise lifetime determination of the 2+1 and 3?1 state of 136 Xe from data taken with the AGATA demonstrator. The method of Coulex-Multipolarimetry with relativistic heavy-ion beams allows for the measurement of electromagnetic multipole-mixing ratios of γ-radiation. The core of the method is the determination of velocity-dependent Coulomb excitation cross sections at two different relativistic ion energies. These can be determined in one single measurement by distinguishing excitations in two spatially separated targets via different observed Doppler-shifts that can be reliably separated in γ-ray tracking detectors. This method was employed during the PreSPEC-AGATA campaign in the experiment S426 at GSI?s FRS in 2014.","2015-07","2024-12-09 22:08:00","2024-12-09 22:38:45","","","","","","","","","","","","","Technische Universität Darmstadt","","en","","Doctoral dissertation","","","","","","","","","DSAM; GRETA; lifetime measurement; multipole mixing ratio; radioactive ion beam; #university/tu-darmstadt","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For instance, neutron rich even-even molybdenum isotopes are associated with a shape-phase transition. A spherical vibrator nucleus is observed for N=48 neutrons, while measurements indicate a deformed rotor nucleus for N=64 neutrons. In order to characterize the shape of molybdenum nuclei better, thus the shape-phase transition in molybdenum isotopes, a PreSPEC-AGATA experiment was performed at GSI. In particular, the experiment aimed at measuring the lifetime of the 4+ excited state of 108Mo to deduce the decay transition rate of the 4+ state. The production of 108Mo was performed in two steps. First, the GSI Fragment-Separator (FRS) selected 109Tc ions produced via fission of a 238U beam. Then, 109Tc ions underwent a fragmentation reaction on a beryllium secondary target. Half-speed of light fragments produced in this second reaction were identified by the Lund-York-Cologne CAlorimeter (LYCCA). gamma-rays were detected by the AGATA array positioned around the secondary target at forward angles. A complex electronics and data-acquisition system was set up to record the coincidences between a flying ion and the gamma-rays it emitted. The interaction position of gamma-rays inside an AGATA crystal is determined with good resolution. Therefore, combined with the large Doppler shift of the gamma-ray, it provides a unique possibility to measure lifetime with the Geometrical-Doppler-Shift-Attenuation method. From the data analysis which included several new techniques, the half-life of T1/2 = 11 (+16;-6) ps was extracted for the first 4+ state of 108Mo. The statistics recorded in this experiment is relatively low which leads to a large uncertainty on this measurement. With this large uncertainty, it is not possible to conclude on the exact behavior of the 108Mo nucleus, even though the comparison of our measurement with geometrical models would favor a transitional nucleus with approximate X(5) solution of the Bohr-Hamiltonian. However, this measurement proves the possibility of lifetime determination coupling relativistic ion beams with the AGATA array. Therefore, it represents a crucial step towards more precise measurements that will be performed at HISPEC with the increased beam intensity provided by the Super-FRS at FAIR.","2015","2024-12-09 22:08:00","2024-12-09 22:44:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","Technische Universität Darmstadt","","en","","Doctoral dissertation","","","","","","","","","lifetime measurement; PreSPEC; #university/tu-darmstadt","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The experiment performed on the neutron deficient 104Sn aimed to deduce the reduced transition probability of the first excited 2+ state quantified by the B(E2; 0+ → 2+) value. This result is the central point in the discussion of the evolution of nuclear structure in proximity of the doubly magic nucleus 100Sn. As 100Sn is not yet accessible for such measurements, a series of experiments have been performed for neutron-deficient Sn isotopes over the past few years. These data showed excessive ex- perimental B(E2) strength compared to shell model calculations below neutron number N=64 and they are therefore not excluding a constant or even increasing collectivity below 106Sn. Hence, the measurement of the B(E2) value in the next even-even isotope toward 100Sn, i.e. 104Sn, was a crucial step to verify the robustness of the shell gap of 100Sn. Moreover, 104Sn is the heaviest isotope of the Sn isotopic chain for which a shell model calculation without significant truncation of the valence space can be performed and therefore with this experimental value the validity of Large Scale Shell Model (LSSM) calculations could be tested. As a main result of the experiment a B(E2) value corresponding to 0.10(4) e2b2 has been extracted for 104Sn. The experi- mental value showed a very good agreement with the predicted one and, despite the large error bar, it clearly established a downward trend of the B(E2) values of the Sn isotopic chain toward A=100. This implied enhanced stability of the N = Z = 50 shell closure against ph-excited quadrupole modes. However, an experiment of this kind is very challenging for several reasons. First, 104Sn lies in proximity of the proton drip line and has therefore a small production cross section, second, the high energy of the beam causes a large background which by far dominates the γ-ray spectra. To over- come the last aspect, an investigation of the components of the background has been performed taking advantage of the complexity of the PreSPEC experimental setup, which provides over 1000 parameters for the detailed analysis of the events. In addi- tion to the known radiation produced in atomic processes, evidences of interactions of high energy protons, provoking a loss of the detection efficiency and a worsening of the quality of the data, have been observed. However, from the new information obtained on the background in the PreSPEC data, several improvements of the setup are sug- gested in view of new challenging experiments in the future with HISPEC/DESPEC at the FAIR facility.","2014-11","2024-12-09 22:08:00","2024-12-09 22:44:56","","","","","","","","","","","","","Technische Universität Darmstadt","","en","","Doctoral dissertation","","","","","","","","","#university/tu-darmstadt","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this investigation was the determination of the ρ?(E0;0+1 -¿ 0+2) transition strength in the heavy deformed nucleus 150Nd. The experimental form factor of this particular transition has been compared to a theoretical form factor that has been constructed by an effective density operator on a microscopic level with the help of the generator coordinate method. The required collective wave functions have been calculated in the Confined β-soft rotor model. In this model-dependent analysis the E0 transition strength has been determined for the first time. Furthermore the evolution of the E0 transition strength as a function of the potential stiffness has been investigated from the X(5) phase shape transitional point to the Rigid Rotor limit. It has been shown, that the E0 strength is relatively high at the shape-phase transitional point and starts to decrease with increasing stiffness and vanishes completely at the Rigid Rotor limit. Additionally the wave functions of the macroscopic collective Confined β-soft rotor model have been compared to those from a microscopic mean field Hamiltonian. Good agreement has been found. The second part of this thesis covers a polarized-proton scattering experiment on the heavy deformed nucleus 154Sm, that has been performed at the RCNP in Osaka, Japan. Utilizing the method of polarization transfer observables, a separation of spinflip and non-spinflip parts of the cross section has been done. Here, for the first time, the Pygmy Dipole Resonance (PDR) has been identified in the heavy deformed nucleus 154Sm that appears as a double-hump structure in the E1 response. A possible interpretation of this double-hump structure in terms of a deformation splitting analogously to the Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) has been given. In case of the spinflip cross section, a broad distribution in the excitation energy range between 6 and 12 MeV has been observed. The distribution and the extracted sum strength are in good accordance with previous experiments.","2014-06","2024-12-09 22:08:00","2024-12-09 22:44:51","","","","","","","","","","","","","Technische Universität Darmstadt","","en","","Doctoral dissertation","","","","","","","","","#university/tu-darmstadt","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The nature of one-phonon symmetric and mixed-symmetric 2+ and 3? states of 92Zr was investigated by comparison with predictions of the quasi-particle phonon model (QPM). Theoretical (e, e?) cross sections have been calculated within the distorted wave Born approximation(DWBA) to account for Coulomb distortion effects. The reduced strengths of the one-quadrupole phonon states and the one-octupole phonon state have been extracted. The similarity of the momentum-transfer dependence of the form factors between the 2+ states supports the one-phonon nature of the 2+2 state of 92Zr. A new method based on the Plane Wave Born Approximation (PWBA) for a model-independent determination of the ratio of the E2 transition strengths of fully symmetric (FSS) and mixed-symmetry (MSS) one-phonon excitations of heavy vibrational nuclei is introduced. Due to the sensitivity of electron scattering to charge distributions, the charge transition-radii difference can be determined. The basic assumptions (independence from the ratio of Coulomb corrections and from absolute values of transition radii) are tested within the Tassie model, which makes no specific assumptions about the structure of the states other than collectivity. It is shown that a PWBA analysis of the form factors, which usually fails for heavy nuclei, can nevertheless be applied in a relative analysis. This is a new promising approach to determine the ground state transition strength of the 2+ MSS of vibrational nuclei with a precision limited only by the experimental information about the B(E2; 2+1 → 0+1) strength. The PWBA approach furthermore provides information about differences of the proton transition radii of the respective states, containing independent information about the mixed-symmetry character of 2+ states and the sign change of leading valence shell components between FSS and MSS. For 92Zr, the proton transition radii difference of the 2+1 and 2+2 states agree with zero within about 0.5 fm, consistent with predictions of a sign change of the leading neutron component in the wave function of the mixed-symmetry 2+2 state, while the leading proton components remain unchanged. The extracted B(E2) strength of the transition of the 2+ 2 state of 94Zr using the new method is smaller than the B(E2) value of the 2+1 state in contrast to a previous but in agreement with a recent (n,n?γ) experiment. The transition radii difference in 94Zr is ?0.24(34) fm compatible with zero. Additional data available on 94Mo were analyzed showing that the momentum transfer dependence of Coulomb corrections leads to a difference of more than 10% between the lowest and the highest measured momentum transfer. If corrected by the Tassie model, a transition radii difference R = ?0.13(5) fm differing from zero is found. This can be interpreted as a sign of an increase of the leading proton two-quasiparticle component in the wave function of the mixedsymmetry 2+ state. The B(E2) ratio for 94Mo, 0.193(1), differs from literature, 0.138(2).","2013","2024-12-09 22:08:00","2024-12-09 22:36:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","Technische Universität Darmstadt","","en","","Doctoral dissertation","","","","","","","","","#university/tu-darmstadt","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dabei wurde eine Methode entwickelt, die auf der (quasi-)kontinuierlichen Messung des Compton-Streuwinkels basiert. Hier werden die Ergebnisse der Polarisationssensitivität des 36-fach segmentierten DAGATA-Polarimeters gezeigt. Die Polarisationssensitivität wurde in einem Experiment anhand einer 60Co-Quelle mit einer Aktivität von 680 kBq für zwei Übergangsenergien aus der 4+ - 2+ - 0+ -Kaskade in 60Ni kalibriert. Mit der Polarisationssensitivität konnte auch die Figure-of-Merit für die Photonenenergien von 1173 und 1332 keV berechnet werden. Beim Kalibrierungsexperiment zur Bestimmung der Polarisationssensitivität des DAGATA-Polarimeters handelte es sich um ein Koinzidenzexperiment mithilfe zweier externen Detektoren. Die Richtungen der externen Detektoren definierten eine Quantisierungsachse bezüglich jedes Detektors. Somit wurden die polarisierten Photonen aus Koinzidenzmessungen gewonnen. Die emittierten Photonen besitzen einen Polarisationsgrad von 1/6, wenn der Winkel zwischen ihren Emissionsrichtungen 90? beträgt. Die unpolarisierten Photonen erhielt man in Singlemessungen. In dieser Arbeit wurden die theoretischen Grundlagen der Polarisation behandelt und wichtige Observablen hergeleitet, die bei der Messung der Polarisation verwendet wurden. Das DAGATA-Polarimeter ist ein neuartiges Compton-Polarimeter. Es werden neue Größen benötigt, um seine Polarisationssensitivität erst erhalten zu können. Die Analyse des Experiments geschah aufgrund von Informationen, die die Segmente des DAGATA-Polarimeters lieferten. Damit konnten die Wechselwirkungsorte bis auf die Segmentvolumen bestimmt werden. Zur Auswertung der experimentellen Daten wurden die Schwerpunkte der Segmente verwendet (Segmentbasis), die aus den Simulationen bestimmt wurden. Die für die Analyse benötigten Winkel wurden aus den Schwerpunktkoordinaten berechnet und in Form einer Tabelle aufgelistet. Durch Einführung einer neuen Asymmetrie, die auf den unterschiedlichen Streuverteilungen der polarisierten und unpolarisierten Ereignisse zwischen Detektorsegmenten basierte, wurde die Polarisationssensitivität des DAGATA-Polarimeters definiert. Die aus dem Kalibrierungsexperiment bestimmten Polarisationssensitivitäten auf Segmentbasis betrugen 21(3)% bei 1173 keV und 19(1)% bei 1332 keV.

The 3D position sensitivity of the HPGe detectors is based on differences in the shape of the charge pulses associated with different interaction points inside the whole volume. It is therefore necessary for this analysis to have a data base containing pulses for all the interaction points inside the detector volume. A full 3D scanning of the detectors, which experimentally determines pulse shapes for each position inside the active volume, is therefore needed. In this thesis, a novel scanning system is presented to determine the HPGe detector pulse shapes as a function of the gamma-ray interaction position inside the detector. The device is based on a pulse shape comparison scan (PSCS) and the positron annihilation correlation (PAC) method which makes it about 100 times faster than the conventional coincidence based scanners. The performance and efficiency of the system is superior because of using a position sensitive detector (PSD)/gamma camera. It consists of a LYSO scintillating crystal optically coupled to a position sensitive photomultiplier tube. The individual multianode readout (IMAR) approach is used to achieve a spatial resolution of <code>126</code> 1 mm and to optimize its field of view to <code>126</code> 28 cm^2. A Compton scattering imaging technique is implemented to perform an accurate position calibration of the gamma camera. The employment of PSD yields an added advantage of imaging capability which allows to study e.g. the details of the inner structure of HPGe detectors and electric field anisotropy effects. The position response of a planar HPGe detector is obtained using the apparatus and the risetime distribution plots are compared with those obtained via a conventional scanning system. However, to validate the aforementioned scanning principle, an AGATA symmetric detector is tested. The risetime values are measured as a function of the interaction position in both the coaxial and quasi-planar region of the detector. Furthermore, the Multi Geometry Simulation (MGS) code is used to generate theoretical distribution plots for comparison. The transition in charge carrier transport behaviour as a function of the depth is studied for the region of the complex electric field. Systematic deviations between simulation and measurement are observed for the critical front part of the AGATA detector. They are interpolated as due to a non-linear impurity concentration profile of the germanium crystal, asking for rigorous scanning of all detectors in the future.","2011-06","2024-12-09 22:08:00","2024-12-09 22:44:57","","","","","","","","","","","","","Technische Universität Darmstadt","","en","","Doctoral dissertation","","","","","","","","","#university/tu-darmstadt","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The evolution of the collectivity (spontaneous deformation) is governed by the proton-neutron interaction in the valence shell. Nuclear states that are particularly sensitive to the proton-neutron interaction in the valence shell are the so called mixed symmetry states (MSSs). In this work we trace the evolution of the fundamental MSS, i.e the one-quadrupole phonon 2+_1,ms state, in a transitional region from vibrational nuclei (134Xe) to gamma-soft nuclei reflecting the O(6)-like structure of the IBM-2 (124,126Xe). Projectile-Coulomb excitation of Xe isotopes has been performed at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) using the Gammasphere array for the detection of gamma-rays. First, our data on more than 50 absolute E2 transition rates between off-yrast low-spin states of 124,126Xe enable us to quantitatively test O(6) symmetry in these two nuclei. As a result we find that O(6) symmetry is more strongly broken in the A=130 mass region than previously thought. Then, 19 absolute E2 transition strengths have been obtained in 128Xe including the first measurement of the critical B(E2) decays from the second and third Jpi=0+ states. These data are compared with the theoretical predictions of the critical point symmetry E(5) and let us conclude that 128Xe is not an E(5) nucleus as previously suggested, leaving 130Xe as the most likely candidate amongst the xenon isotopes. Finally, the one-phonon 2+_1,ms states or at least a fragment of it have been identified in 128,130,132,134Xe. This enables us to trace the evolution of the one-phonon 2+_1,ms states in the even-even stable xenon isotopic chain from the vibrators near N=82 to the gamma-soft nuclei towards mid-shell.","2010-06","2024-12-09 22:08:00","2024-12-09 22:45:03","","","","","","","","","","","","","Technische Universität Darmstadt","","en","","Doctoral dissertation","","","","","","","","","#university/tu-darmstadt","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
