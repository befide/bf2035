    The main objective of the CARE project was to generate a structured and
    integrated European area in the field of accelerator research and related
    R&D. A set of integrating activities involving the largest European
    infrastructure laboratories and their user communities “active in
    accelerator R&D”, including industrial partners was established with the
    following general objectives: 1) To optimise the use of existing
    infrastructures for improving the European knowledge on accelerator physics
     By promoting a coherent and coordinated utilization and development of
    infrastructures and to facilitate the access to accelerators and test
    facilities for carrying accelerator studies  By understanding accelerator
    operation and reliability issues 2) To tackle new or state-of-the-art
    technologies in a more co-ordinated and collaborative approach  By
    developing a coherent and coordinated accelerator R&D program in Europe and
    carrying out joint R&D projects allowing one to enhance the existing (or in
    construction) facilities provided by the research infrastructures. These
    facilities could also be used as test beds for future projects either  by
    developing and testing advanced accelerator components  by exploring and
    testing new ideas and concepts. More generally, by establishing a closer
    interaction between a large number of scientist 3) To enhance the
    collaboration amongst accelerator physicists on the one hand and to develop
    the synergy between particle physicists and accelerator physicists on the
    other hand.  By promoting inter-disciplinary collaboration including
    industry  By developing further and reinforcing the European expertise for
    the conception, design, development, construction and operation of new
    particle accelerators for High Energy Physics. The framework of CARE has
    successfully integrated the subjects, the infrastructures and the expertise.
