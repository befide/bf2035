    The short-pulse facility at the 1.5-GeV synchrotron light source DELTA,
    operated by the TU Dortmund University, generates coherent VUV radiation by
    Coherent Harmonic Generation (CHG) as well as coherent THz pulses. The goal
    is to provide femtosecond coherent VUVradiation pulses for time-resolved
    pump-probe experiments. CHG is based on the interaction of ultrashort laser
    pulses with electrons in an undulator to generate synchrotron radiation
    pulses of similar length, but at coherent harmonics of the laser wavelength.
    The goals of this PhD thesis were the characterization of the CHG pulses and
    the preparation of the first pump-probe experiments with the new light
    source. The CHG pulses were characterized using different methods which are
    applied either at a diagnostics beamline in air (for long wavelengths of 200
    nm and above) or at an evacuated VUV beamline (for 200 nm and below). The
    characterization includes studying the transverse and longitudinal coherence
    properties of the CHG pulses, the intensity of the radiation, its angular
    and spectral distribution, estimate of the energy modulation, and the
    dependence of these properties on different parameters. In order to perform
    pump-probe experiments, an evacuated laser beamline of 53 m length was
    constructed and commissioned to guide some part of the laser pulses to the
    experimental station at the VUV beamline. This included optimizing and
    focusing the laser beam, realizing the temporal and transverse overlap
    between pump and probe pulses, controlling and monitoring the beam position
    with motorized in-vacuum mirrors and diagnostics screens, and stabilizing
    the angle and position of the beam using an optical feedback system.
