    In this work, a special application of the nuclear resonance fluorescence
    technique has been used and further advanced to study nuclear structure
    effects: so-called relative self-absorption experiments. They allow for the
    direct determination of ground-state transition widths of excited states, an
    important quantity for comparisons to model calculations, as well as the
    level width and the branching ratio to the ground state of individual states
    in a model-independent way. Two self-absorption measurements have been
    performed. On the one hand, the absolute excitation widths and the decay
    pattern of low-lying excited dipole states in the energy regime of the pygmy
    dipole resonance have been investigated in the nucleus $^{140}$Ce. The
    results of the nuclear resonance fluorescence measurement, which is part of
    a self-absorption experiment, as well as of the actual self-absorption
    measurement are presented for 117 and 104 excited states of $^{140}$Ce,
    respectively. They are compared to previous measurements and discussed with
    respect to the statistical model. On the other hand, a high-precision
    measurement of the self absorption of the $T=1$, $J^{\pi}=0^+_1$ level at an
    excitation energy of \unit[3563]{keV} in $^6$Li has been conducted. A
    precisely measured level width of this state can serve as a benchmark for
    modern ab-inito calculations.
