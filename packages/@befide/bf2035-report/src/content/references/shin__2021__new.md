    Abstract
                There had been remarkable progress in developing third-generation electron storage rings as the main sources of very bright photon beams. Fourth-generation storage rings based on the multi-bend achromat lattice concept may be able to surpass the brightness and coherence that are attained using present third-generation storage rings. In this paper, we survey ongoing work around the world to develop concepts and designs for fourth-generation electron storage rings.
