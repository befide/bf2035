    This doctoral thesis focuses on the utilization of γ-ray tracking for the
    distinction between different scenarios, such as various possible incident
    γ-ray energies or different points of their origin. Such scenarios arose in
    an experimental benchmark test of the so-called Coulex-multipolarimetry, as
    well as in a first simulation-based approach to potential competitive double
    γ-decay experiments with the Advanced GAmma Tracking Array AGATA. The first
    benchmark of the Coulex-multipolarimetry was performed during the PreSPEC
    campaign at the GSI Helmholtzzentrum für Schwerionenforschung in 2014 to
    identify the potential πp3/2 → πp1/2 spin-flip transition in the neutron-
    rich 85Br via measurement of the E2/M1 multipole mixing ratio δ. The
    achieved performance of said first benchmark test is presented using
    standard methods of γ-spectroscopy as well as γ-ray tracking and derived
    methods. The competitive double γ decay, measured for the first time in
    137Ba in 2015 via LaBr3(Ce) detectors, is a potential source for new
    information about nuclear structure. Since angular and energy correlations
    between the emitted γ rays are one of the main sources of said information,
    AGATA with its high angular and energy resolution appears to be predestined
    for this task. Due to its comparatively small time resolution capabilities,
    a successful distinction between single and double γ-decay events, however,
    has to fully rely on γ-ray tracking techniques. Whether such measurements of
    the double γ decay with AGATA are feasible is verified in this work based on
    simulations. Novel insights into γ-ray tracking which arose during the
    analysis resulted in the development of a novel γ-ray tracking algorithm,
    called ExpTrack , based on experimentally achieved Compton-scattering
    angles. This new approach is also presented in this work.
