  abstract: >-
    As the next generation of large accelerator-based facilities are being
    considered at the Snowmass 2021 study high priority has to be given to
    environmental sustainability including energy consumption, natural resource
    use and the environmental impact of effluents. Typically, increased
    performance - higher beam energies and intensities - of proposed new
    facilities have come with increased electric power consumption. In the
    following we discuss the most important areas of development for the
    sustainability of accelerator-based research infrastructures in three
    categories - technologies, concepts and general aspects. To achieve the goal
    of increased performance with reduced energy consumption a focused R&D
    effort is required with the same or even higher priority as the traditional
    performance-related R&D. Such a recommendation was included in the recent
    European Strategy for Particle Physics Accelerator R&D Roadmap.
