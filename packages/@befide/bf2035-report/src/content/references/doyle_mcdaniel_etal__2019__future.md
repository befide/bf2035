    This section updates Volume 4 of the Reviews of Accelerator Science and
    Technology titled “Accelerator Applications in Industry and the
    Environment,” published in 2011 [A. W. Chao and W. Chou (eds.), Reviews of
    Accelerator Science and Technology, Accelerator Applications in Industry and
    the Environment, Vol. 4 (World Scientific, 2011)]. We also include the new
    material available about this field following the publication of “The Beam
    Business: Accelerators in Industry” in 2011 [R. W. Hamm and M. E. Hamm,
    Physics Today 46–51 (June 2011)] and “Industrial Accelerators and Their
    Applications” in 2012 [R. W. Hamm and M. E. Hamm, Industrial Accelerators
    and Their Applications (World Scientific, 2012)], both written and co-edited
    by one of us (RWH). We start with some general trends in industrial
    accelerator developments and applications and then move on to bringing the
    up-to-date developments in each article of Volume 4. In this regard, we owe
    a debt of gratitude to many of the authors of sections of RAST-[Formula: see
    text] , and they are gratefully acknowledged in each of their individual
    update submissions.
