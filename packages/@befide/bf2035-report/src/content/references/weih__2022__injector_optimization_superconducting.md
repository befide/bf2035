  abstract: >-
    The former 5-cell capture cavity of the S-DALINAC injector was
    insufficiently adapted to the beam energies provided by the electron
    sources. This led to an inefficient energy gain and a deterioration of the
    beam quality in this acceleration structure. In order to optimize the
    performance of the injector, especially with regard to an accelerator
    operation in the energy-recovery mode, it was therefore necessary to replace
    the 5-cell cavity with a dedicated β-adapted capture structure. This project
    was implemented within the scope of this dissertation. A new β-reduced
    6-cell structure was manufactured, tested and installed at the accelerator.
    Tuner frame components had to be adapted to the novel geometry and
    mechanical features of the cavity. To achieve an exchange of the cavities
    within a regular maintenance shutdown, full compatibility with the existing
    cryostat was prioritized during the design of the modified cryomodule
    components. In addition, a beam diagnostic setup was conceptualized,
    installed and commissioned upstream of the capture cavity. This setup was
    used to characterize momentum spreads of the beam along the
    normal-conducting injector section with a relative uncertainty of ±2 %.
    Furthermore, parameters of the beam entering the superconducting injector
    section, which have a significant influence on the achievable injector beam
    quality, could be optimized. After the cool-down of the installed capture
    cavity, full functionality of the upgraded cryomodule was shown. First beam
    parameter studies were conducted at the optimized injector. The results were
    benchmarked against the former injector setup. Besides a reduction of the
    momentum spread by a factor of around four, a substantially improved energy
    gain of up to 1.4 MeV was achieved in the new capture structure for an
    incident beam energy of 250 keV. Furthermore, a decreased bunch length was
    observed at the injector beam, which had already proven beneficial for the
    overall S-DALINAC performance during ERL experiments following the
    commissioning. The optimized injector is fully operational and is now
    available for further beam operation at the S-DALINAC.
