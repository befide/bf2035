  abstract: >-
    Cooperation between Research Infrastructures (RIs) and industry
    stakeholders, encompassing users, collaborators, and component providers,
    represents a pivotal mission for ESFRI RIs. To gain a comprehensive
    understanding of these collaborative dynamics and to pinpoint areas where
    RIs may require further support in fostering industry partnerships, the
    ESFRI drafting group on Industrial Co-operation was established. This
    initiative aligns seamlessly with the December 2022 conclusions of the
    Council of the European Union, a cornerstone in the development of the
    European Research Area (ERA). To facilitate the drafting group's mission, an
    online survey was conducted in December 2022, serving a dual purpose: (1)
    deepening the comprehension of the scope and scale of collaborative ventures
    between industry and RIs, and (2) charting the course for future directions
    and support needed to empower Research Infrastructures in effectively
    engaging with industry. <br> This survey serves as a complementary effort to
    the 2022 survey of ESFRI Research Infrastructures (Landmarks). It responds
    to a recommendation from the earlier report to explore the perspectives of
    industrial partners on cooperation with research infrastructures, making it
    a focal point of the insights presented in this document.
