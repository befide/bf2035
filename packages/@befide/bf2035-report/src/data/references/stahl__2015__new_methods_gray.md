  abstract: >-
    This doctoral thesis describes two new experimental techniques for in-beam
    γ-ray spectroscopy that exploit the position-sensitivity of the latest
    generation of high-purity Germanium detectors, so-called γ-ray tracking
    detectors. These detectors allow to determine the interaction points of
    γ-ray quanta within the detector material with unrivaled accuracy. The
    continuous-angle Doppler-Shift Attenuation Method extends the well-known DSA
    Method for the measurement of nuclear level lifetimes by providing a
    complete description of the observed characteristic, Doppler-broadened γ-ray
    lineshapes as a function of the energy and detection polar angle of the
    γ-rays. The method?s power is demonstrated by the precise lifetime
    determination of the 2+1 and 3?1 state of 136 Xe from data taken with the
    AGATA demonstrator. The method of Coulex-Multipolarimetry with relativistic
    heavy-ion beams allows for the measurement of electromagnetic
    multipole-mixing ratios of γ-radiation. The core of the method is the
    determination of velocity-dependent Coulomb excitation cross sections at two
    different relativistic ion energies. These can be determined in one single
    measurement by distinguishing excitations in two spatially separated targets
    via different observed Doppler-shifts that can be reliably separated in
    γ-ray tracking detectors. This method was employed during the PreSPEC-AGATA
    campaign in the experiment S426 at GSI?s FRS in 2014.
