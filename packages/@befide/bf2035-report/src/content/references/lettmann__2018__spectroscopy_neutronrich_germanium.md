    This work covers the spectroscopic analysis of 84,86,88Ge and 94,96Kr
    isotopes populated by different reactions within the SEASTAR campaign 2015.
    The experimental setup and the data analysis are described in detail. This
    analysis includes necessary functionality checks and calibrations of the
    detectors along the beam line. In-flight γ-ray spectroscopy of 84,86,88Ge
    was performed after various knock-out reactions. γ-spectroscopy of
    neutron-rich 88Ge was performed for the first time. The Doppler-corrected
    γ-ray spectra are analyzed with simulated lineshapes of occurring
    transitions. In total 16 transitions are observed ten of which so far
    unknown. New level schemes for 86,88 Ge are proposed based on the observed
    transition intensities and systematics of neighboring Ge isotopes. The
    obtained level schemes are compared to state-of-the-art theoretical
    calculations. The assignment of a 3⁺ state of 86Ge agrees with new shell
    model and SCCM predictions. The agreement to the level orderings from the
    collective model by Davydov and co-workers points to an amount of rigid
    triaxiality in 86Ge. This is the first indication of rigid triaxiality in an
    unstable, neutron-rich nucleus. In addition, an analysis of reaction cross
    sections, as well as cross sections for the excitation of a particular state
    is performed. This data set represents one of the first results for this
    newly-accessible region of the nuclear chart. Furthermore, 84,86Ge and
    94,96Kr are investigated after (p,p') reactions, which excite different
    states than the knock-out reactions. These states are candidates for
    octupole 3⁻ states, which are the first benchmark for the octupole degree of
    freedom in this exotic region. The obtained (p,p') cross sections of the 2⁺₁
    states from 94,96Kr are compared to the transition strength known from
    literature based on the deformation length.
