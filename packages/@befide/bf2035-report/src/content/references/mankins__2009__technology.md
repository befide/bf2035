    The development of new system capabilities typically depends upon the prior
    success of advanced technology research and development efforts. These
    systems developments inevitably face the three major challenges of any
    project: performance, schedule and budget. Done well, advanced technology
    programs can substantially reduce the uncertainty in all three of these
    dimensions of project management. Done poorly, or not at all, and new system
    developments suffer from cost overruns, schedule delays and the steady
    erosion of initial performance objectives. It is often critical for senior
    management to be able to determine which of these two paths is more
    likely—and to respond accordingly. The challenge for system and technology
    managers is to be able to make clear, well-documented assessments of
    technology readiness and risks, and to do so at key points in the life cycle
    of the program. In the mid 1970s, the National Aeronautics and Space
    Administration (NASA) introduced the concept of “technology readiness
    levels” (TRLs) as a discipline-independent, programmatic ﬁgure of merit
    (FOM) to allow more effective assessment of, and communication regarding the
    maturity of new technologies. In 1995, the TRL scale was further
    strengthened by the articulation of the ﬁrst deﬁnitions of each level, along
    with examples (J. Mankins, Technology readiness levels, A White Paper, NASA,
    Washington, DC, 1995. [1]). Since then, TRLs have been embraced by the U.S.
    Congress’ General Accountability Ofﬁce (GAO), adopted by the U.S. Department
    of Defense (DOD), and are being considered for use by numerous other
    organizations. Overall, the TRLs have proved to be highly effective in
    communicating the status of new technologies among sometimes diverse
    organizations.
