    Within the scope of this thesis, a test stand Photo-CATCH for research on
    semiconductor photocathodes used at the spin-polarized electron injector of
    the superconducting Darmstadt electron linear accelerator S-DALINAC is
    constructed and brought into operation. Ultra-high vacuum conditions are
    achieved in all parts of the system. Atomic-hydrogen assisted
    low-temperature cleaning of cathodes in a chamber with base pressure better
    than 3 E-11 mbar is used for preparing clean cathode surfaces for negative
    electron affinity (NEA) activation. Using a standardised activation
    procedure, atomic-hydrogen cleaning of heavily contaminated bulk-GaAs
    samples is optimized to an upper limit of 10 kL hydrogen-dosage. Cleaning of
    samples has been performed with a dosage as low as 0.7 kL. Activation of
    photocathodes with Cs+O2 and Cs+Li+O2 have been studied in a dedicated
    vacuum chamber with base pressure better than 2 E-11 mbar. By using a 405 nm
    laser, quantum efficiencies above 25 % have been achieved from an NEA-GaAs
    photocathode. Oxygen-induced quantum-efficiency degradation of NEA cathodes
    has been investigated. A vacuum lifetime of (298+/-35) hours was observed in
    the activation chamber for a novel two-stage activation using Cs, O2 and Li.
    This system can provide photocathodes with high quantum efficiency and
    lifetime for polarized and unpolarized beam production at the 60 keV
    electron beamline of Photo-CATCH. Additionally, atomic-hydrogen cleaned
    cathode samples can be transported to the photoelectron source at S-DALINAC
    using a transport-vessel conceptualized in this work.
