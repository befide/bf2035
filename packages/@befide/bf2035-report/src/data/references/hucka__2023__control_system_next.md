    The construction of the upcoming FAIR facility entails an upgrade of the
    existing GSI accelerator facility. One of the upgrades is the integration of
    the new LSA control system framework, which is licensed and adapted from
    CERN, in order to provide a unified control environment for all
    accelerators, rings and transfer lines at both the GSI and FAIR facility. As
    part of this work, it was possible to incorporate the FRS as a machine-model
    within LSA by developing and implementing Parameter hierarchies and
    Makerules to enable streamlined and maximum parallel operations. For this
    purpose a FRS General Target Hierarchy was implemented to virtually map
    targets, target ladders, degraders, degrader disks, degrader ladders,
    detectors and detector ladders as realistically as possible with additional
    Makerules to facilitate automated online energy-loss calculations, secondary
    beam production within targets, operator driven magnetic rigidity
    overwriting and ion-optical target alignment calculations. Additionally
    slits, pneumatic drives and stepper motors were introduced into the
    machine-model, as well. Benchmarking proved for the machine-model and LSA to
    be equivalent to previous control systems by reproducing old experimental
    settings within an accuracy of 10^-4 and 10^-3 for the magnetic rigidity and
    current, respectively. Contemporary experiments can be even identically
    reproduced within the measurement and setting precision. Additional testing
    with a Ar-40 and U-238 primary beam showed the machine-model's capabilities
    in correctly transporting primary and secondary beam fragments to the
    destined experimental station without previous setting calculation via
    LISE++, proving all functionalities operative. This foundation was used
    during FAIR Phase-0 experiments at the GSI to produce and using the methods
    described here it was possible to preliminarily identify up to 21 new
    isotopes with a relativistic Pb-208 primary beam at 1050 AMeV impinging on a
    beryllium target of 4 g/cm^2 thickness with a niobium stripper backing of
    225 mg/cm^2 thickness to first produce Re-200, -201, -202, W-198, -199,
    Ta-195, -196, -197, Hf-191, -192, -193, Lu-189, -190, -191, Yb-186, -187,
    Tm-182, -183, -184, -185 and Er-181.
