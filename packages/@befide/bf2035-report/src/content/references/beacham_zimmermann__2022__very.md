    The long-term prospect of building a hadron collider around the
    circumference of a great circle of the Moon is sketched. A Circular Collider
    on the Moon (CCM) of $\sim$11000 km in circumference could reach a
    proton-proton center-of-mass collision energy of 14 PeV -- a thousand times
    higher than the Large Hadron Collider at CERN -- optimistically assuming a
    dipole magnetic field of 20 T. Several aspects of such a project are
    presented, including siting, construction, availability of necessary
    materials on the Moon, and powering, as well as a discussion of future
    studies and further information needed to determine the more concrete
    feasibility of each. Machine parameters and vacuum requirements are
    explored, and an injection scheme is delineated. Other unknowns are set
    down. Due to the strong interest from multiple organizations in establishing
    a permanent Moon presence, a CCM could be the (next-to-)
    next-to-next-generation discovery machine for high-energy particle physics
    and a natural successor to next-generation machines, such as the proposed
    Future Circular Collider at CERN or a Super Proton-Proton Collider in China,
    and other future machines, such as a Collider in the Sea, in the Gulf of
    Mexico. A CCM would serve as an important stepping stone towards a
    Planck-scale collider sited in our Solar System.
