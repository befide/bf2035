  abstract: >-
    Antihydrogen atoms are synthesized via charge-exchange or
    three-body-recombination processes for stringent CPT symmetry and gravity
    tests on antimatter at CERN's Antiproton Decelerator. While the atoms are
    produced in a wide range of highly excited Rydberg states, experiments rely
    on ground state antihydrogen which are currently obtained only via
    spontaneous emission. Due to radiative lifetimes of the order of
    milliseconds, the decay toward ground state is slow. Magnetic neutral-atom
    traps allow to hold onto the initially formed antihydrogen. Here, ground
    state atoms are obtained via spontaneous decay along the trapping potential
    and spectroscopy measurements can be performed inside the trap. Typical
    traps capture maximum temperatures (for ground state atoms) of roughly
    500mK. State-of-the-art formation temperatures, however, lie around 40K. Due
    to the large difference between formation and trappable temperature,
    currently best achieved trapping fractions of antihydrogen amount to only
    0.01%. As an alternative, the formed anti-atoms can be extracted out of
    their formation region into a beam allowing for close to field-free
    measurements. At the given velocities, the Rydberg radiative decay toward
    ground state is too slow to establish a significant population of the ground
    state through spontaneous emission even within a few meter long beam path.
    In addition, an efficient beam formation would require antihydrogen in
    ground state close to the formation region. This work thus deals with the
    controlled manipulation of Rydberg atoms to stimulate their decay toward
    ground state. In order to address the initial distribution of Rydberg levels
    with deexcitation lasers, state-mixing can be achieved through pulsed
    electric fields that are added to the already present magnetic one in
    state-of-the-art formation traps. Another possibility lies in mixing the
    states with light in the THz and microwave frequency range. In both cases,
    visible lasers allow to very efficiently transfer the mixed population
    toward the ground state via intermediate strongly bound states that decay on
    a few nanosecond timescales. In a three-body-recombination reaction the
    capture of positrons into a bound state of antiprotons can be enhanced
    relying on stimulated radiative recombination. This approach can be combined
    with the developed techniques to deexcite bound levels. In trap experiments
    use-cases of deexcitation for cooling within a magnetic field gradient to
    enhance the trapping fraction of antihydrogen atoms exist. The second part
    of the thesis deals with the experimental implementation of the methods
    theoretically identified in part one. Deexcitation light sources are tested
    and a hydrogen Rydberg beamline for a proof-of-principle experiment is
    designed, built and commissioned. Different Rydberg beam production schemes
    are discussed and experimentally assessed. Rydberg state formation is
    observed within a microwave discharge plasma and a hydrogen 2s to Rydberg
    excitation laser is commissioned.
