    At the Forschungszentrum Jülich (FZJ) the energy variable cyclotron JULIC is
    used as injector of the Cooler Synchrotron (COSY) and for low to medium
    current irradiations of different types. At the NESP-Target station a
    Target-Moderator-Reflector (TMR) -demonstrator of the proposed accelerator
    driven High Brilliance Neutron source (HBS) was set up with the Jülich
    Center of Neutron Science (JCNS). Beside showing the functionality of the
    TMR-Design the demonstrator gives the possibility to test new target
    materials, different types and concepts of moderators and at least the
    handling of irradiated targets and components. The TMR- target station is
    installed inside an Experimental area offering space for complex detector
    and component setups for nuclear and neutron related experiments like
    ToF-experiments or neutron imaging e.g. But it is used for other purposes
    like irradiation and electronic or detector tests as well. Additionally to
    the TMR, the extraction beamline from JULIC to the TMR was set up and
    equipped with a fast kicker and a 3-field permanent magnet, as foreseen in
    in HBS to deliver the beam to different target stations within a
    sophisticated pulsing scheme, synchronized with the beam pulsing done at
    JULIC, using fast deflection plates. This report briefly summarizes the
    history of JULIC and the activities for its future perspectives.
