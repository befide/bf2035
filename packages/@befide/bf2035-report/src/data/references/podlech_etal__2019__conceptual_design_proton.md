  abstract: >-
    Due to the decommissioning of several research reactors there will be a
    severe drop in available neutrons for research in Europe in the next decade
    despite the commissioning of the European Spallation Source (ESS). Compact
    accelerator-based neutron sources (CANS) could close this gap. The High
    Brilliance Neutron Source (HBS) currently under development at
    Forschungszentrum Jülich is scalable in terms of beam energy and power due
    to its modular design. The driver Linac for HBS at will accelerate a 100 mA
    proton beam to 70 MeV. The Linac is operated with a beam duty cycle of up to
    6% (11% RF duty cycle) and can simultaneously deliver three proton pulse
    lengths (384 Hz@52 mu-s, 96 Hz@208 mu-s and 24 Hz@832 mu-s) for three
    neutron production targets. In order to minimize the development effort and
    the technological risk, state-of-the-art technology of the MYRRHA injector
    is used. The front end of the HBS Linac consists of an ECR source, LEBT and
    a 2.5 MeV RFQ followed by a CH-DTL with 35 room temperature CH-cavities. All
    RF structures are operated at 176.1 MHz and are designed for high duty
    cycle. Solid-state amplifiers up to 500 kW are used as RF drivers. Due to
    the beam current and the high average beam power of up to 420 kW, particular
    attention is paid to beam dynamics. In order to minimize losses, a
    quasi-periodic lattice with constant negative phase is used. The
    contribution describes the conceptual design and the challenges of such a
    modern high power proton accelerator with high reliability and availability.
