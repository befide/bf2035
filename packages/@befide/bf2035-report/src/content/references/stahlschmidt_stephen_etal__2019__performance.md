    This study updates the annual analysis of the performance and structures of
    the German Science System in international comparison. Bibliometric
    indicators are presented and discussed for the period 2007-2017. In
    addition, a comparison between the two major data sources used for
    bibliometric analysis, Web of Science and Scopus, is presented in order to
    assess the impact the choice of the data source has on the performance
    indicators. Both data sources differ in their selection philosophy. While
    Elsevier intends for Scopus to be the largest database, Clarivate Analytics
    is confident that capturing high-quality journals offers sufficient data to
    be representative of each discipline. In general, the differing business
    philosophies result in differences in the thresholds at which the inclusion
    criteria for indexation are applied. This subsequently affects the coverage
    of the databases. Due to the higher number of journals and other sources
    covered in Scopus compared to Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science (WoS) the
    overall number of publications and their citations are typically higher in
    Scopus. Reacting to the ongoing debate of the appropriateness of the
    selective approach Clarivate Analytics pursues it recently introduced a new
    index, the Emerging Sources Index (ESCI), which, while making concessions
    with regard to the selection criteria, extends the coverage significantly.
    The ESCI sought to improve regional and field-specific coverage; however, to
    date neither the bias towards publications from Europe and North America nor
    the over-represention of the natural and medical sciences and under
    representation of the arts and humanities has been solved. Which also holds
    true for Scopus. Both databases use a journal-based classification system,
    meaning that not the individual article but, the whole journal is assigned
    to a category. Overall, the Web of Science seems to perform significantly
    better than Scopus in terms of the accuracy of assigning journals to
    classification categories, which might affect field-normalised scores.
    Overall, we observe an increasing number of publication between 2007 and
    2017 for most countries. This increase is due to increased publication
    output as such but also reflects the increased coverage of journals by WoS
    and Scopus. The growth is particularly countries like China and India and
    other countries with developing science systems such as South Africa, South
    Korea and Brazil. While for countries with well-established systems such as
    the USA, the UK, Germany and France growth rates are rather low resulting
    also in their decreasing publication shares. China and the USA continue to
    be the countries producing the highest number of publications. Germany
    maintained its standing as one of countries producing the highest number of
    publications, and publications of high quality. Compared to 2007, Germany is
    publishing in journals with greater international visibility, but receiving
    fewer citations in those journals. With regard to the Excellence Rate
    Germany’s position is rather stable above the threshold. China continues to
    improve its performance also with regard to this indicator and meanwhile
    almost reaching the expected value. Difference in indicator values such as
    Excellence Rates and proportions of uncited publications between both
    databases (both higher in Scopus than WoS) are due to Scopus’ inclusion of
    journals of lesser visibility compared to those in WoS. In general, the
    patterns observed in high- and low-performing countries was largely the same
    across the databases, despite the differences in figures. Unbowed is the
    overall trend towards increasing co-authorship, reflecting increasing
    collaboration. Also for Germany, the proportion of publications with
    international collaboration has increased. Switzerland remains the country
    with the highest share of internationally co-authored papers. As observed in
    the past, international co-authorship is particular high in smaller
    countries like Belgium or the Nordic countries. The USA remain the most
    attractive partner for most countries. Obvious is – from an US-America


    2 perspective - the strong increase of the share of publications co-authored
    between the USA and China reflecting increasing collaborations between these
    two countries, while the share of co-authored publications with other
    countries remains mainly stable. Looking at the different actors within
    Germany shows an upward trend in publications over time, which corresponds
    to the overall growing number of publication for Germany as whole. We
    observe slight changes when it comes to the performance of the sectors: the
    Helmholtz Association continues to produce the highest number of
    publications followed by the Max-Planck Society, which, however, produced
    fewer publications annually since 2012 and consequently its share of German
    publications dropped. An increasing share, though still at a low level can
    be observed for the Fachhochschulen. They doubled the number of their
    publications as well as their share of German publications over the
    reference period. Indicators also reflect that Fachhochschulen and each of
    the research associations are increasingly publishing in more highly-cited
    journals though their publications in these journals are receiving
    relatively fewer citations.
