    There are still challenges to broader and effective access to Research
    Infrastructures (RIs) as needed by users to tackle scientific and societal
    challenges and to underpin the new European Research Area (ERA).The
    objectives of the ESFRI Drafting Group on Access are to identify these
    challenges, propose ways to address them and propose orientations for the
    revision of the European Charter of Access to Research Infrastructures (the
    ‘Charter’). This work is part of Action 8 of the ERA Policy Agenda
    2022-2024: ‘Strengthen sustainability, accessibility and resilience of
    research infrastructures in the ERA’.


    To this end, the ESFRI Drafting Group on Access implemented in May-June 2023
    two parallel surveys: one detailed survey targeting research infrastructures
    (individual ones or networks with joint access scheme) and one targeting RI
    stakeholders.The respondents express a large diversity of types of access
    (physical, remote, virtual), nature of service offered (access to equipment,
    to data, to collection etc.), including within an RI, often depending on the
    domain and the nature of the RI (single site or distributed). Among the
    barriers to broader access, several legal, institutional, and financial
    aspects were raised as well as technical aspects. The trends related to
    multidisciplinary efforts, innovation, and green and digital transitions
    were also discussed. In addition, respondents provided feedback on EU
    support for transnational and virtual access.


    The outcome of the survey is presented in detail in this report. Preliminary
    recommendations to address access challenges and revise the Charter are
    tentatively listed and are summarised hereafter.
