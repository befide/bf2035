    This study examines how the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) scale became,
    through various mutations, an innovation policy tool of the European Union
    (EU), and summarizes the risks and opportunities created along the way. The
    paper presents a comparative study about the evolution of two
    innovation-related policies that share a common concept. This
    document-centric study relies on position papers, white papers, government
    documents, policy documents and research program descriptions. The paper
    establishes that the concreteness and sophistication of the TRL scale
    gradually diminished as its usage spread outside its original context (space
    programs). A discipline-specific tailoring of the scale is essential in
    every area before application. Yet for a number of disciplines this has not
    happened, while in some other areas the available customizations and
    handbooks are not used in EU context. This uncritical usage of the scale in
    the current EU framework program seems to carry more risks than advantages.
    In the absence of discipline-specific guides, TRLs will predictably become a
    source of confusion and a subject of abuse in efforts to obtain EU funding.
