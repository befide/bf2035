    In the framework of this thesis electron scattering experiments on
    low-energy excitations of 92Zr and 94Zr were performed at the S-DALINAC in a
    momentum transfer range q = 0.3 ? 0.6 fm^?1. The nature of one-phonon
    symmetric and mixed-symmetric 2+ and 3? states of 92Zr was investigated by
    comparison with predictions of the quasi-particle phonon model (QPM).
    Theoretical (e, e?) cross sections have been calculated within the distorted
    wave Born approximation(DWBA) to account for Coulomb distortion effects. The
    reduced strengths of the one-quadrupole phonon states and the one-octupole
    phonon state have been extracted. The similarity of the momentum-transfer
    dependence of the form factors between the 2+ states supports the one-phonon
    nature of the 2+2 state of 92Zr. A new method based on the Plane Wave Born
    Approximation (PWBA) for a model-independent determination of the ratio of
    the E2 transition strengths of fully symmetric (FSS) and mixed-symmetry
    (MSS) one-phonon excitations of heavy vibrational nuclei is introduced. Due
    to the sensitivity of electron scattering to charge distributions, the
    charge transition-radii difference can be determined. The basic assumptions
    (independence from the ratio of Coulomb corrections and from absolute values
    of transition radii) are tested within the Tassie model, which makes no
    specific assumptions about the structure of the states other than
    collectivity. It is shown that a PWBA analysis of the form factors, which
    usually fails for heavy nuclei, can nevertheless be applied in a relative
    analysis. This is a new promising approach to determine the ground state
    transition strength of the 2+ MSS of vibrational nuclei with a precision
    limited only by the experimental information about the B(E2; 2+1 → 0+1)
    strength. The PWBA approach furthermore provides information about
    differences of the proton transition radii of the respective states,
    containing independent information about the mixed-symmetry character of 2+
    states and the sign change of leading valence shell components between FSS
    and MSS. For 92Zr, the proton transition radii difference of the 2+1 and 2+2
    states agree with zero within about 0.5 fm, consistent with predictions of a
    sign change of the leading neutron component in the wave function of the
    mixed-symmetry 2+2 state, while the leading proton components remain
    unchanged. The extracted B(E2) strength of the transition of the 2+ 2 state
    of 94Zr using the new method is smaller than the B(E2) value of the 2+1
    state in contrast to a previous but in agreement with a recent (n,n?γ)
    experiment. The transition radii difference in 94Zr is ?0.24(34) fm
    compatible with zero. Additional data available on 94Mo were analyzed
    showing that the momentum transfer dependence of Coulomb corrections leads
    to a difference of more than 10% between the lowest and the highest measured
    momentum transfer. If corrected by the Tassie model, a transition radii
    difference R = ?0.13(5) fm differing from zero is found. This can be
    interpreted as a sign of an increase of the leading proton two-quasiparticle
    component in the wave function of the mixedsymmetry 2+ state. The B(E2)
    ratio for 94Mo, 0.193(1), differs from literature, 0.138(2).
