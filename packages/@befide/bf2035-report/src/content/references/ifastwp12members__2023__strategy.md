    Particle accelerators are already extensively used in health and industry
    for a wide range of applications, including cancer treatment, polymer
    modification, sterilisation of medical products, radioisotope production,
    imaging, phyto-sanitation, food treatment, etc. These exploit the unique
    features of the accelerated beams and the control the use of accelerators
    provides. Nevertheless, accelerators have a much greater potential which is
    currently not being fully exploited. This is due to many reasons, including
    a lack of knowledge in industry of what benefits they could bring, the
    perceived and real cost of the technology, the absence of the skills
    required to assess the potential for a specific industry and to implement
    the technology and concerns over safety and regulation.
