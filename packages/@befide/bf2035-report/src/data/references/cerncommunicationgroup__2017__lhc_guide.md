  abstract: >-
    This is a collection of facts and figures about the Large Hadron Collider
    (LHC) in the form of questions and answers. Questions are grouped into
    sections, and answers are often two-tier, with more details in the second
    level. Please note that when speaking about particle collisions in the
    accelerator, the word ‘interaction’ is a synonym of ‘collision’.
