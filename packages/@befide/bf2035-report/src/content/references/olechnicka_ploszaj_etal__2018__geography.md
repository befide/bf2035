    Science is increasingly defined by multidimensional collaborative networks.
    Despite the unprecedented growth of scientific collaboration around the
    globe—the collaborative turn—geography still matters for the cognitive
    enterprise. The spatial location and distance between scholars and research
    organisations affect their likelihood to collaborate and to achieve results
    that expand the knowledge frontier. At the same time, the developmental
    prospects of cities, regions, and countries result from, and depend on,
    their place in the global network of research collaboration.


    This book explores how geography conditions scientific collaboration and how
    collaboration affects the spatiality of science. Addressing these questions
    requires the reconstruction of historical developments that led to the
    collaborative turn in science, the examination of mutual relations between
    science and places, and the analysis of spatial patterns of research
    collaboration at various levels: from individual to global. By combining a
    vast array of approaches, concepts, and methodologies, the volume offers a
    comprehensive theoretical framework for the geography of scientific
    collaboration.


    The momentous role of collaboration for contemporary science implies that
    understanding the processes and patterns of research collaboration is now
    essential, not only for scholars interested in science studies, but also for
    policymakers and managers of research organisations. Those more practically
    oriented readers may be particularly attracted by the case studies of
    scientific collaboration policies from the European Union, the United
    States, and China, as well as the catalogue of tools for scientific
    collaboration policy.
