  abstract: >-
    The theoretical minimum emittance (TME) for a storage ring is given if both
    the horizontal betatron and the dispersion function have a minimum in the
    middle oft the bending magnet and furthermore meet special values. In most
    of the storage rings the emittance is a factor 2 to 5 higher as the
    TME-value. The TME can be reached with a new type of lattice composed of
    combined function bending magnets and a quadrupole doublet at each side
    following by a drift space of 2 to 3 m: DRIFT / Q(d) / Q(f) / BENDING / Q(f)
    /Q(d) / DRIFT. With a 20 degree bending magnet it is possible to reach an
    emittance down to 9 nmrad at 3 GeV (which is only 14 % higher as the
    TME-value). With a circumference of 250m and 18 unit cells (20 degree
    bending magnet) it is possible to use up to 50 % of the circumference for
    the installation of insertion devices. With a 10 degree bending magnet
    (3GeV) it is possible to reach an emittance of 1.5 nmrad .
