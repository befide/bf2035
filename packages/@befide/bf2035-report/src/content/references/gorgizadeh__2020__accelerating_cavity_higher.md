    This thesis takes the first steps towards a detailed design for the large RF
    system of the lepton collider version of the Future Circular Collider
    (FCC-ee). First, this thesis investigates a suitable baseline option for the
    RF system of FCC-ee. This includes the search for an appropriate RF
    frequency and number-of-cells per cavity for each working point of FCC-ee.
    RF accelerating cavities and higher order mode (HOM) couplers are then
    designed based on the requirements of each operation energy. The
    performances of the HOM damped cavities are finally evaluated using various
    numerical methods.
