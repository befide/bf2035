    A pioneering collection of case studies on the global phenomenon of academic
    excellence initiatives and how they shape the performance of research
    universities.

    Academic excellence initiatives (AEIs)—special government-sponsored programs
    to improve research universities—have provided billions of dollars to top
    universities and represent perhaps the most significant effort in the past
    half-century to jump-start academic research. The contributors to Academic
    Star Wars, superbly edited by Maria Yudkevich, Philip G. Altbach, and Jamil
    Salmi, analyze AEIs in nine European and Asian countries, including China,
    Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, Denmark, France, Germany, and Russia,
    and offer penetrating insights into the successes and problems of these
    initiatives, as well as into the broader system of higher education itself.

    Academic Star Wars provides a comprehensive analysis of AEIs across the
    globe as it seeks to understand the impact of these programs on national
    higher ed systems. The contributors explore a host of topics, including how
    the idea of excellence varies across national systems; the lessons to be
    drawn from the most successful AEIs; the consequences of AEIs, both intended
    and unintended, for participating universities; and whether AEIs ensure a
    significant impact on the global standing of national higher education
    systems. Finally, the contributors offer policy recommendations for national
    decision-makers and university leaders, taking into account the variety of
    initial conditions of national higher education systems and the differences
    in AEI design, scope, and funding.
