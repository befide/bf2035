    Particle accelerators are the drivers for large-scale research
    infrastructures for particle physics but also for many branches of condensed
    matter research. The types of accelerator-driven research infrastructures
    include particle colliders, neutron, muon or neutrino sources, synchrotron
    light sources and free-electron lasers, as well as medical applications.
    These facilities are often large and complex and have a significant carbon
    footprint, both in construction and operation. In all facilities grid power
    is converted to beam power and ultimately to the desired type of radiation
    for research. The energy efficiency of this conversion process can be
    optimized using efficient technologies, but also with optimal concepts for
    entire facilities.
