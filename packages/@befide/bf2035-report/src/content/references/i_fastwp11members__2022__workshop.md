    The 2022 workshop Energy for Sustainable Science is the 6<sup>th</sup>
    workshop in a series and was held at ESRF in Grenoble. The workshop focuses
    on energy consumption, energy management and efficiency of research
    infrastructures in particular, but it also covers a wider context of
    sustainability and societal aspects. At the workshop best practices of RIâ€™s
    are reviewed and measures to improve sustainability are proposed. While many
    contributions were dealing with energy saving measures and intelligent
    energy management, the topics of using rare earth - and other critical
    materials, as well as sustainable live cycle management of components were
    addressed for the first time in this workshop series
