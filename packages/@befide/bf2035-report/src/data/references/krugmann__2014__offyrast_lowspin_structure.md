    The present work consists of two independent parts. The first part deals
    with the investigation of the 0+1 -¿ 0+2 transition in 150Nd with inelastic
    electron scattering and in the second part a proton scattering experiment
    for the investigation of dipole excitations is presented. In the first part
    of this thesis a pioneer experiment in inelastic electron scattering is
    introduced. At an electron energy of 75 MeV, excitation energy spectra have
    been measured at the high resolution 169? spectrometer at the S-DALINAC. The
    aim of this investigation was the determination of the ρ?(E0;0+1 -¿ 0+2)
    transition strength in the heavy deformed nucleus 150Nd. The experimental
    form factor of this particular transition has been compared to a theoretical
    form factor that has been constructed by an effective density operator on a
    microscopic level with the help of the generator coordinate method. The
    required collective wave functions have been calculated in the Confined
    β-soft rotor model. In this model-dependent analysis the E0 transition
    strength has been determined for the first time. Furthermore the evolution
    of the E0 transition strength as a function of the potential stiffness has
    been investigated from the X(5) phase shape transitional point to the Rigid
    Rotor limit. It has been shown, that the E0 strength is relatively high at
    the shape-phase transitional point and starts to decrease with increasing
    stiffness and vanishes completely at the Rigid Rotor limit. Additionally the
    wave functions of the macroscopic collective Confined β-soft rotor model
    have been compared to those from a microscopic mean field Hamiltonian. Good
    agreement has been found. The second part of this thesis covers a
    polarized-proton scattering experiment on the heavy deformed nucleus 154Sm,
    that has been performed at the RCNP in Osaka, Japan. Utilizing the method of
    polarization transfer observables, a separation of spinflip and non-spinflip
    parts of the cross section has been done. Here, for the first time, the
    Pygmy Dipole Resonance (PDR) has been identified in the heavy deformed
    nucleus 154Sm that appears as a double-hump structure in the E1 response. A
    possible interpretation of this double-hump structure in terms of a
    deformation splitting analogously to the Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) has
    been given. In case of the spinflip cross section, a broad distribution in
    the excitation energy range between 6 and 12 MeV has been observed. The
    distribution and the extracted sum strength are in good accordance with
    previous experiments.
