    Laser-plasma accelerators are capable of sustaining accelerating fields of
    10–100 GeV/m, 100–1000 times that of conventional technology and the highest
    fields produced by any of the widely researched advanced accelerator
    concepts. Laser-plasma accelerators also intrinsically accelerate short
    particle bunches, several orders of magnitude shorter than that of
    conventional technology, which leads to reductions in beamstrahlung and,
    hence, savings in the overall power consumption to reach a desired
    luminosity. These properties make laser-plasma accelerators a promising
    accelerator technology for a more compact, less expensive high-energy linear
    collider providing multi-TeV polarized leptons. In this submission to the
    Snowmass 2021 Accelerator Frontier, we discuss the motivation for a
    laser-plasma-accelerator-based linear collider, the status of the field, and
    potential linear collider concepts up to 15 TeV. We outline the research and
    development path toward a collider based on laser-plasma accelerator
    technology, and highlight near-term and mid-term applications of this
    technology on the collider development path. The required experimental
    facilities to carry out this research are described. We conclude with
    community recommendations developed during Snowmass.
