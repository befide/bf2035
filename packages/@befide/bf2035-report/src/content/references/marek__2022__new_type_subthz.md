  abstract: >-
    This work presents the development and systematic investigation of a new
    sub-THz source for the generation of trains of coherent high-power
    ultra-short pulses at 263 GHz via passive mode-locking of two coupled
    helical gyrotron traveling wave tubes (helical gyro-TWT). The frequency of
    263 GHz is an established figure for continuous wave (CW) DNP-NMR
    application and, therefore, the investigated source will allow the
    development of novel spectroscopy methods such as time-domain DNP-NMR for
    which powerful sub-THz pulses with highest coherency are required.

    For the first time, it is shown that the operation of the passive
    mode-locked helical gyro-TWTs in the hard excitation regime is of particular
    importance to reach the optimal coherency of the generated pulses. To enable
    the operation in the hard excitation regime, a new extended passive
    mode-locked oscillator is proposed. The extended passive mode-locked
    oscillator will furthermore enable the generation of specific pulse
    sequences in addition to the generation of pulses with constant repetition
    frequency. This could be of particular interest for some time-domain DNP-NMR
    methods where well-defined pulse sequences are required.
