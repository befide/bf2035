    Electron beams can be generated by utilizing the internal photoelectric
    effect. In this matter, a special photocathode material is necessary for
    generating polarized electrons. Gallium arsenide (GaAs) proved to be the
    best choice. However, the production of polarized electrons requires a
    photo-emission close to the band gap, which in turn requires a
    negative-electron-affinity (NEA) coating consisting of caesium (Cs) and
    either oxygen or nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). This layer limits the possible
    operation time of the electron source as the layer deteriorates over time
    due to interactions with residual gas particles, with contamination through
    desorption and degradiation through ionized particles hitting the surface
    being the two main mechanisms. The latter is called ion back-bombardment
    (IBB) and is the main lifetime-limiting factor during high-current electron
    emission. Therefore, a reduction of IBB in order to increase operational
    lifetime and performance of electron sources is of great interest for many
    accelerator-based applications with polarized electrons. In this
    dissertation the design, assembly and first experimental results of a new
    kind of electron source is presented, which aims at reducing IBB by placing
    the cathode inside an almost closed cryogenic sub-volume. The inner walls of
    this volume are coated with activated charcoal making them act as a
    cryopump, reducing the local pressure significantly. The closed design
    limits the flux of particles from the outer, higher vacuum into the volume.
    Simulations of the hydrogen partial pressure, which contributes the most to
    IBB, shows a reduction of up to two magnitudes compared to conventional
    sources. As IBB intensity directly scales with the amount of residual gas
    molecules, a significant increase in lifetime can is anticipated. In
    addition, the cooling of the cathode itself compensates the heat load
    deposited by the laser beam, hence reducing heat-induced desorption of the
    NEA layer that would otherwise severely limit cathode lifetime for
    high-current applications. A pressure below 1 ⋅ 10^-11 mbar outside the
    sub-volume could be achieved after a four-week bake-out at 120 °C inside an
    aluminum vacuum chamber equipped with a 45 l/s ion-getter pump and four 430
    l/s non-evaporable getter panels. Electrostatic field simulations for
    electrode voltages ranging from -5 kV to -30 kV have been conducted, showing
    a maximum field gradient of 11.1(1) MV/m at -30 kV. Experimentally, a stable
    voltage of -12 kV without and -14 kV with cooling of the electrode has be
    achieved. Simulations of the electron beam at potentials from -12 kV to -30
    kV showed no beam loss for currents from 10 µA to 1 mA. The required cooling
    power was provided by a 1.1 W closed-cycle cryostat. A temperature of
    21.3(1) K at the far end of the sub-volume has be reached allowing an
    effective pumping of hydrogen. A dedicated test stand was designed and setup
    at the Institut für Kernphysik of the Technische Universität Darmstadt to
    conduct measurements evaluating a potential lifetime enhancing effect. It
    does not feature a chamber to conduct the process of applying the NEA layer
    to the photocathode surface, also called photocathode activation, hence
    requiring the use of the existing test stand for Photo-Cathode Activation,
    Testing, and Cleaning using atomic Hydrogen (Photo-CATCH) for the cleaning
    and activation procedure. A measurement series demonstrated that a transport
    chamber, equipped with a NEG pump, is capable of retaining enough of the NEA
    layer, to allow a transfer of activated cathode from Photo-Catch to the new
    electron source. After transferring and storing for 20 h a quantum
    efficiency (QE) of up to 67 % using a re laser with 780 nm and 99 % with a
    blue 450 nm laser could be maintained. For a foreseen integration of the
    source into Photo-CATCH, simulations show that with minor modifications of
    the beamline an operation of both the cryogenic and the conventional source,
    already in place, is possible. A measurement demonstrating a life time
    enhancing effect could not be conducted, as the beam was lost at an unknown
    location in the system. Multiple approaches were conducted to identify the
    origin of the beam loss, offering room for further exploration.
