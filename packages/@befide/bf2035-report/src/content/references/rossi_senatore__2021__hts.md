    In view of the preparation for a post-LHC collider, in 2010 the high-energy
    physics (HEP) community started to discuss various options, including the
    use of HTS for very high-field dipoles. Therefore, a small program was begun
    in Europe that aimed at exploring the possibility of using HTS for
    accelerator-quality magnets. Based on various EU-funded programs, though at
    modest levels, it has enabled the European community of accelerator magnet
    research to start getting experience in HTS and address a few issues. The
    program was based on the use of REBa2Cu3O7−x (REBCO) tapes to form 10 kA
    Roebel cables to wind small dipoles of 30–40 mm aperture in the 5 T range.
    The dipoles are designed to be later inserted in a background dipole field
    (in Nb3Sn), to reach eventually a field level in the 16–20 T range, beyond
    the reach of Low Temperature Superconductors (LTS). The program is currently
    underway: more than 1 km of high-performance tape (Je > 500 A/mm2 at 20 T,
    4.2 K) has been manufactured and characterized, various 30 m long Roebel
    cables have been assembled and validated up to 13 kA, a few dipoles have
    been wound and tested, reaching 4.5 T in stand-alone (while a dipole made
    from flat race track coils exceeded 5 T using stacked tape cable), and tests
    in background field are being organized.
