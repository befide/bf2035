  abstract: >-
    Based on presentations and discussions at two iFAST workshops, we review and
    classify present-day applications of artificial intelligence and machine
    learning in the field of particle accelerators, illustrating the various
    types of deployment and their demonstrated merits by way of example.
    Extrapolating ongoing trends and sketching possible future developments, we
    formulate a few open questions, and issue R&amp;D recommendations. In
    particular, we suggest the construction of a testbed for self-controlling
    complex accelerators
