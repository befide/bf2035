    A quantum shape phase transition (QSPT) in atomic nuclei is characterized by
    a sudden change of the shape of the nucleus due to changes in the location
    of the nuclear potential minimum. A first-order QSPT exists in the
    transition from spherical shapes to the axially symmetric deformed shapes.
    There are models describing even-even nuclei in terms of their shape and
    their oscillations and rotations symmetries, such us the U(5) symmetry (for
    spherical shapes - vibrator) and SU(3) symmetry (for axially symmetric
    deformed shapes - rotor). Along the QSPT the spherical minimum,
    corresponding to a spherical shape, starts vanishing and the deformed one,
    corresponding to a deformed shape, appears. While the nuclear potentials of
    a vibrator and a symmetric rotor have one minimum, the potential of a
    nucleus near the critical point (CP) of the first-order QSPT between them
    presents the two competing minima. The X(5) model provides some signatures
    of the isotopes at the CP. A first-order QSPT is known in the even-even N=90
    isotones with Z=60?66. With Z=58, 148Ce lies in the low-Z boundary of this
    transition from spherical to axially symmetric deformed shapes. This nucleus
    is studied in this work. Key observables revealing the nuclear shape, such
    as the energy ratio R4/2=E(4+1)/E(2+1) and the transition strength ratio
    B4/2=B(E2;4+1→2+1)/B(E2;2+1→0+1), are compared with the predictions from
    models describing nuclei along this transition and specially near the CP.
    The experimental analysis to obtain the lifetimes of the first 2+ and first
    4+ states of 148Ce using fast-timing techniques is shown in this work. The
    data were taken within the EXILL&FATIMA campaign performed at the high-flux
    reactor of the Institut Laue-Langevin in Grenoble, where fission fragments
    of 235U and 241Pu were measured by a hybrid spectrometer, consisting of
    high-resolution germanium and fast-responding lanthanum bromide scintillator
    detectors. The measurement of the lifetime of the first 4 + state of 148 Ce
    allows the calculation of the B4/2 observable and contributes in the study
    of the shape of the nucleus. Beside the comparison with the models, the
    whole N ≈ 90 region is being investigated within the interacting boson
    model. The shape evolution of the cerium, the neodymium and the samarium
    chains is studied and shows the importance of the increasing axially
    asymmetry.
