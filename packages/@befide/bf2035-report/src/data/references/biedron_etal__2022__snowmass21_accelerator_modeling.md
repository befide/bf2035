  abstract: >-
    After a summary of relevant comments and recommendations from various
    reports over the last ten years, this paper examines the modeling needs in
    accelerator physics, from the modeling of single beams and individual
    accelerator elements, to the realization of virtual twins that replicate all
    the complexity to model a particle accelerator complex as accurately as
    possible. We then discuss cutting-edge and emerging computing opportunities,
    such as advanced algorithms, AI/ML and quantum computing, computational
    needs in hardware, software performance, portability and scalability, and
    needs for scalable I/O and in-situ analysis. Considerations of reliability,
    long-term sustainability, user support and training are considered next,
    before discussing the benefits of ecosystems with integrated workflows based
    on standardized input and output, and with integrated frameworks and data
    repositories developed as a community. Last, we highlight how the community
    can work more collaboratively and efficiently through the development of
    consortia and centers, and via collaboration with industry.
