    In this work, the decay behavior of dipole strength of {$^9$}{$^6$}Mo and
    ?{$^5$}{$^0$}Nd after excitation with high-energy photons was investigated.
    For this purpose, multiple experiments at the {\ensuremath{\gamma}}? setup
    and clover array setup at the High-Intensity {\ensuremath{\gamma}}-ray
    Source (HI{\ensuremath{\gamma}}S) at Duke University and at the Darmstadt
    High-Intensity Photon Setup (DHIPS) of the superconducting Darmstadt
    electron linear accelerator (S-DALINAC) at Technische Universit{\"a}t
    Darmstadt were performed. For the ?{$^5$}{$^0$}Nd experiment at
    HI{\ensuremath{\gamma}}S, the laser-Compton backscattering photon beam was
    operated in a new high-resolution mode, with an energy resolution of
    {\ensuremath{\Delta}}E/E {$\approx$}â€¯2â€¯\%. The high energy resolution
    allowed, for the first time, the spectral separation of different decay
    components into the ground state band for a heavy deformed nucleus. Between
    4â€¯MeV and 7â€¯MeV, an almost constant average branching ratio of 0.481(71)
    between the decay to the 2{$^+$}{$_1$} state and the ground state was
    observed. By introducing an internal fluctuation ratio s, the statistical
    distribution of partial transition widths was deduced. The observations are
    consistent with {\ensuremath{\chi}}?-distributed transition widths with
    degree of freedom {\ensuremath{\nu}}â€¯=â€¯1.82(10), and inconsistent with
    the Porter-Thomas distribution {\ensuremath{\nu}}â€¯=â€¯1. Additionally, in
    combination with the DHIPS experiment, properties of individual states and
    the photon-scattering cross section were determined. For the {$^9$}{$^6$}Mo
    experiment, utilizing {\ensuremath{\gamma}}{\ensuremath{\gamma}}-coincidence
    measurements in combination with a linearly polarized quasi-monochromatic
    photon beam, the photon strength functions (PSFs) were determined that are
    built on top of excited 2{$^+$} states, which were then combined into a
    single downward PSF. The general shape and slope of the determined PSF agree
    very well with experiments using complementary probes, however, it is much
    smoother and exhibits fewer fluctuations in comparison to the literature
    values. This deviation indicates a possible violation of the Brink-Axel
    hypothesis for the studied energy range.}
