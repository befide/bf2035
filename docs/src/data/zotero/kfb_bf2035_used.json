  {"id":"abela_etal__2023__european_strategy_acceleratorbased","abstract":"The League of European Accelerator-based Photon Sources (LEAPS), comprising 19 large-scale user facilities in 10 member and associated states, has put forward for the first time a European strategy for a transformative way of cooperation, thereby mobilizing the members’ substantial expertise in photon science and technology, in infrastructure management and service to users and stakeholders. This European Strategy for Accelerator-based Photon Sources—ESAPS 2022—is a coherent pan-European plan addressing the future challenges and needs of the new era in research and innovation, designed to put Europe in a global leadership position in important future key technologies. In ESAPS2022, ambitious facility upgrades and technology development plans as well as a new strategic challenge-driven use of these facilities are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Abela","given":"R."},{"family":"Biscari","given":"C."},{"family":"Daillant","given":"J."},{"family":"Dosch","given":"H."},{"family":"Rivkin","given":"L."}],"citation-key":"abela_etal__2023__european_strategy_acceleratorbased","container-title":"The European Physical Journal Plus","container-title-short":"Eur.

  {"id":"agarwal_etal__2022__snowmass_2021_community","abstract":"The Snowmass Community Survey was designed by the Snowmass Early Career (SEC) Survey Core Initiative team between April 2020 and June 2021, and released to the community on June 28, 2021. It aims to be a comprehensive assessment of the state of the high-energy particle and astrophysics (HEPA) community, if not the field, though the Snowmass process is largely based within the United States. Among other topics, some of the central foci of the Survey were to gather demographic, career, physics outlook, and workplace culture data on a large segment of the Snowmass community. With nearly $1500$ total interactions with the Survey, the SEC Survey team hopes the findings and discussions within this report will be of service to the community over the next decade.

  {"id":"alonso_etal__2020__highluminosity_large_hadron","abstract":"The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is one of the largest scientific instruments ever built. Since opening up a new energy frontier for exploration in 2010, it has gathered a global user community of about 9000 scientists working in fundamental particle physics and the physics of hadronic matter at extreme temperature and density. To sustain and extend its discovery potential, the LHC will need a major upgrade in the 2020s. This will increase its instantaneous luminosity (rate of collisions) by a factor of five beyond the original design value and the integrated luminosity (total number of collisions) by a factor ten. The LHC is already a highly complex and exquisitely optimised machine so this upgrade must be carefully conceived and will require new infrastructures (underground and on surface) and over a decade to implement. The new configuration, known as High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), relies on a number of key innovations that push accelerator technology beyond its present limits. Among these are cutting-edge 11–12 Tesla superconducting magnets, compact superconducting cavities for beam rotation with ultra-precise phase control, new technology and physical processes for beam collimation and 100 metre-long high-power superconducting links with negligible energy dissipation, all of which required several years of dedicated R&D effort on a global international level.","author":[{"family":"Alonso","given":"I Béjar"},{"family":"Brüning","given":"O"},{"family":"Fessia","given":"P"},{"family":"Lamont","given":"M"},{"family":"Rossi","given":"L"},{"family":"Tavian","given":"L"},{"family":"Zerlauth","given":"M"}],"citation-key":"alonso_etal__2020__highluminosity_large_hadron","genre":"Technical Design Report","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"keyword":"_used;#befide/accelerator-based-facility/particle-collider/circular-particle-collider;#befide/accelerator-based-facility/:lhc","language":"en","number":"CERN-2020-10","page":"390","publisher":"CERN","title":"High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC)","type":"report"},

  {"id":"assmann_etal__2020__eupraxia_conceptual_design","abstract":"This report presents the conceptual design of a new European research infrastructure EuPRAXIA. The concept has been established over the last four years in a unique collaboration of 41 laboratories within a Horizon 2020 design study funded by the European Union. EuPRAXIA is the first European project that develops a dedicated particle accelerator research infrastructure based on novel plasma acceleration concepts and laser technology. It focuses on the development of electron accelerators and underlying technologies, their user communities, and the exploitation of existing accelerator infrastructures in Europe. EuPRAXIA has involved, amongst others, the international laser community and industry to build links and bridges with accelerator science — through realising synergies, identifying disruptive ideas, innovating, and fostering knowledge exchange. The Eu-PRAXIA project aims at the construction of an innovative electron accelerator using laser- and electron-beam-driven plasma wakefield acceleration that offers a significant reduction in size and possible savings in cost over current state-of-the-art radiofrequency-based accelerators. The foreseen electron energy range of one to five gigaelectronvolts (GeV) and its performance goals will enable versatile applications in various domains, e.g. as a compact free-electron laser (FEL), compact sources for medical imaging and positron generation, table-top test beams for particle detectors, as well as deeply penetrating X-ray and gamma-ray sources for material testing. EuPRAXIA is designed to be the required stepping stone to possible future plasma-based facilities, such as linear colliders at the high-energy physics (HEP) energy frontier. Consistent with a high-confidence approach, the project includes measures to retire risk by establishing scaled technology demonstrators. This report includes preliminary models for project implementation, cost and schedule that would allow operation of the full Eu-PRAXIA facility within 8—10 years.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Assmann","given":"R.

A Circular Collider on the Moon (CCM) of $\\sim$11000 km in circumference could reach a proton-proton center-of-mass collision energy of 14 PeV -- a thousand times higher than the Large Hadron Collider at CERN -- optimistically assuming a dipole magnetic field of 20 T. Several aspects of such a project are presented, including siting, construction, availability of necessary materials on the Moon, and powering, as well as a discussion of future studies and further information needed to determine the more concrete feasibility of each. Machine parameters and vacuum requirements are explored, and an injection scheme is delineated. Other unknowns are set down. Due to the strong interest from multiple organizations in establishing a permanent Moon presence, a CCM could be the (next-to-) next-to-next-generation discovery machine for high-energy particle physics and a natural successor to next-generation machines, such as the proposed Future Circular Collider at CERN or a Super Proton-Proton Collider in China, and other future machines, such as a Collider in the Sea, in the Gulf of Mexico. A CCM would serve as an important stepping stone towards a Planck-scale collider sited in our Solar System.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,17]]},"archive":"INSPIRE","archive_location":"1867198","author":[{"family":"Beacham","given":"James"},{"family":"Zimmermann","given":"Frank"}],"citation-key":"beacham_zimmermann__2022__very_high_energy","container-title":"New Journal of Physics","container-title-short":"New J.

  {"id":"bitter_etal__2022__transforming_us_particle","abstract":"The pursuit of knowledge in particle physics requires constant learning. As new tools become available, new theories are developed, and physicists search for new answers with ever-evolving methods. However, it is the case that formal educational systems serve as the primary training grounds for particle physicists. Graduate school (and undergraduate school to a lesser extent) is where researchers learn most of the technical skills required for research, develop scientific problem-solving abilities, learn how to establish themselves in their field, and begin developing their career. It is unfortunate, then, that the skills gained by physicists during their formal education are often mismatched with the skills actually required for a successful career in physics. We performed a survey of the U.S. particle physics community to determine the missing elements of graduate and undergraduate education and to gauge how to bridge these gaps. In this contributed paper, part of the 2021-22 Snowmass Community Planning Exercise, we report the results of this survey. We also recommend several specific community actions to improve the quality of particle physics education; the \"community\" here refers to physics departments, national labs, professional societies, funding agencies, and individual physicists.","author":[{"family":"Bitter","given":"O."},{"family":"Hansen","given":"E."},{"family":"Kravitz","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Velan","given":"V."},{"family":"You","given":"Yining"}],"citation-key":"bitter_etal__2022__transforming_us_particle","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,19]]},"keyword":"_used","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Transforming U.S. Particle Physics Education: A Snowmass 2021 Study","title-short":"Transforming U.S. Particle Physics Education","type":"book"},

  {"id":"bogomilov_etal__2024__transverse_emittance_reduction","abstract":"Accelerated muon beams have been considered for the next-generation studies of high-energy lepton–antilepton collisions and neutrino oscillations. However, high-brightness muon beams have not yet been produced. The main challenge for muon acceleration and storage stems from the large phase-space volume occupied by the beam, derived from the production mechanism of muons through the decay of pions. The phase-space volume of the muon beam can be decreased through ionization cooling. Here we show that ionization cooling leads to a reduction in the transverse emittance of muon beams that traverse lithium hydride or liquid hydrogen absorbers in the Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment. Our results represent a substantial advance towards the realization of muon-based facilities that could operate at the energy and intensity frontiers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Bogomilov","given":"M."},{"family":"Tsenov","given":"R."},{"family":"Vankova-Kirilova","given":"G."},{"family":"Song","given":"Y.

  {"id":"bornmann__2016__promotion_research_reflected","abstract":"Under the Excellence Initiative, a number of Clusters of Excellence in Germany have been supported since 2006 and 2007—including each a limited number of cooperating institutions. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether support for Clusters of Excellence since 2006 and 2007 is reflected in bibliometric network data. For this purpose, a comparison is made between network data in the period before support started (2003–2005) and in the period after support started (2009–2011). For these two periods, a co-authorship network is generated (based on the funded institutions). This is based on publications which are among the 1 % most frequently cited publications in their respective fields and publication year and which have at least one author from Germany. As the results show, the outcomes this yields for life sciences and natural sciences differ from each other. Whereas natural sciences display an effect of establishment of Clusters of Excellence on the bibliometric networks, this was not true of life sciences. After establishment of the Clusters of Excellence, the network in natural sciences not only contained more institutions of a Cluster of Excellence, but these institutions were distributed across fewer bibliometric clusters in the network than before establishment. In other words the structure of the Clusters of Excellence was better reflected in the network.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Bornmann","given":"Lutz"}],"citation-key":"bornmann__2016__promotion_research_reflected","container-title":"Scientometrics","container-title-short":"Scientometrics","DOI":"10.1007/s11192-016-1925-2","ISSN":"0138-9130","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"keyword":"#bf2035/issue/excellence;#bf2035/issue/excellence/bibliometrics;_used","page":"1041-1061","PMCID":"PMC4865529","PMID":"27239077","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Is the promotion of research reflected in bibliometric data?

However, in addition to the desired interactions there are unwanted interactions of the high energy particles which can produce undesirable side effects. These interactions can arise from the unavoidable presence of residual gas in the accelerator vacuum chamber, or from the impact of particles lost from the beam on aperture limits around the accelerator, as well as the final beam dump.

Among emerging alternatives to large-scale and costly present-day radiation sources which severely restrict the availability of such beams, compact laser-plasma-accelerator-driven inverse Compton scattering sources show great potential. However, these sources are currently limited to tens of percent bandwidths, unacceptably large for many applications. Here, we show conceptually that using active plasma lenses to tailor the electron bunch-photon interaction, tunable X-ray and gamma beams with percent-level bandwidths can be produced. The central X-ray energy is tunable by varying the focusing strength of the lens, without changing electron bunch properties, allowing for precision-tuning the X-ray beam energy. This method is a key development towards laser-plasma-accelerator-driven narrowband, precision tunable femtosecond photon sources, enabling a paradigm shift and proliferation of compact X-ray applications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Brümmer","given":"T."},{"family":"Bohlen","given":"S."},{"family":"Grüner","given":"F."},{"family":"Osterhoff","given":"J."},{"family":"Põder","given":"K."}],"citation-key":"brummer_etal__2022__compact_alloptical_precisiontunable","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-022-20283-8","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,26]]},"keyword":"#bf2035/research-topic/plasma-acceleration;#befide/accelerating-process/plasma-based-acceleration/plasma-based_laser-driven_acceleration;_used;#befide/accelerator-based-facility/photon-source","language":"en","note":"Read_Status: To Read\nRead_Status_Date: 2024-03-17T10:08:39.662Z","page":"16017","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Compact all-optical precision-tunable narrowband hard Compton X-ray source","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-20283-8","volume":"12"},

The conceptual design of JuSPARC is determined by a set of state-of-the-art time-resolved instruments, which are designed to address the electronic, spin, and structural states of matter and their dynamic behaviour. From these instruments and experiments JuSPARC derives the need of operating several dedicated high pulse-power laser systems at highest possible repetition rates. They serve as core units for optimized photon up-conversion techniques generating the light pulses for the respective experiments. The applications also include experiments with spin-polarized particle beams, which require the use of laser-based polarized gas targets. Thus, in its ﬁrst stage JuSPARC comprises four driving laser systems, called JuSPARC_VEGA, JuSPARC_DENEB, JuSPARC_SIRIUS and JuSPARC_MIRA, which are outlined in this article.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Büscher","given":"Markus"},{"family":"Adam","given":"Roman"},{"family":"Tusche","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Hützen","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Wiemann","given":"Carsten"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Ying-Jiun"},{"family":"Schneider","given":"Claus M."}],"citation-key":"buscher_etal__2020__jusparc_julich_shortpulsed","container-title":"Journal of large-scale research facilities JLSRF","container-title-short":"J. large-scale res. facil.

Snowmass 2021 was a scientific study that provided an opportunity for the entire U.S. particle physics community, along with its international partners, to identify the most important scientific questions in High Energy Physics for the following decade, with an eye to the decade after that, and the experiments, facilities, infrastructure, and R&D needed to pursue them. This Snowmass summary report synthesizes the lessons learned and the main conclusions of the Community Planning Exercise as a whole and presents a community-informed synopsis of U.S. particle physics at the beginning of 2023. This document, along with the Snowmass reports from the various subfields, will provide input to the 2023 Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5) subpanel of the U.S. High-Energy Physics Advisory Panel (HEPAP), and will help to guide and inform the activity of the U.S. particle physics community during the next decade and beyond.","author":[{"family":"Butler","given":"Joel"},{"family":"Chivukula","given":"R.

  {"id":"durante_etal__2019__applied_nuclear_physics","abstract":"Applied nuclear physics is an essential part of the research activity at many particle accelerators. New, large accelerator facilities are currently under construction in Europe, Asia, and USA. These machines will be able to produce radioactive ion beams, and to increase the intensity and the energy of the heavy ions well beyond the limits currently available at the therapy or research facilities. The upcoming facilities open new opportunities for research in biomedical applications that require these special properties, such as particle radiography, radioactive beam imaging, ultra-high dose rates and new ions for therapy. Moreover, space radiation research and materials science can successfully exploit these new centers. The new facilities can pave the way to many future applications of nuclear physics for the benefit of the society. In this paper we will summarize the current status of applied sciences at high-energy accelerators, describe the characteristics of some of the machines under construction (FAIR, NICA, RAON, ELI) and discuss the new opportunities offered by these facilities in applied sciences.","author":[{"family":"Durante","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Golubev","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Park","given":"Woo-Yoon"},{"family":"Trautmann","given":"Christina"}],"citation-key":"durante_etal__2019__applied_nuclear_physics","container-title":"Physics Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.physrep.2019.01.004","ISSN":"0370-1573","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"keyword":"#bf2035/application/science/nuclear-physics;_used","language":"en-US","page":"1 - 37","title":"Applied nuclear physics at the new high-energy particle accelerator facilities","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370157319300043","volume":"800"},

In most of the storage rings the emittance is a factor 2 to 5 higher as the TME-value. The TME can be reached with a new type of lattice composed of combined function bending magnets and a quadrupole doublet at each side following by a drift space of 2 to 3 m: DRIFT / Q(d) / Q(f) / BENDING / Q(f) /Q(d) / DRIFT.

With a circumference of 250m and 18 unit cells (20 degree bending magnet) it is possible to use up to 50 % of the circumference for the installation of insertion devices.

This work is part of Action 8 of the ERA Policy Agenda 2022-2024: ‘Strengthen sustainability, accessibility and resilience of research infrastructures in the ERA’.\n\nTo this end, the ESFRI Drafting Group on Access implemented in May-June 2023 two parallel surveys: one detailed survey targeting research infrastructures (individual ones or networks with joint access scheme) and one targeting RI stakeholders.The respondents express a large diversity of types of access (physical, remote, virtual), nature of service offered (access to equipment, to data, to collection etc.), including within an RI, often depending on the domain and the nature of the RI (single site or distributed). Among the barriers to broader access, several legal, institutional, and financial aspects were raised as well as technical aspects. The trends related to multidisciplinary efforts, innovation, and green and digital transitions were also discussed. In addition, respondents provided feedback on EU support for transnational and virtual access.\n\nThe outcome of the survey is presented in detail in this report. Preliminary recommendations to address access challenges and revise the Charter are tentatively listed and are summarised hereafter.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,10]]},"author":[{"literal":"ESFRI"}],"citation-key":"esfri__2024__esfri_report_access","DOI":"10.5281/zenodo.10555986","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,23]]},"keyword":"#bf2035/stakeholder/esfri;#bf2035/issue/open-science/fair-principles;_used","language":"eng","publisher":"ESFRI","source":"Zenodo","title":"ESFRI Report on Access to Research Infrastructures and Charter on Access to RIs","type":"report","URL":"https://zenodo.org/records/10555986"},

At the NESP-Target station a Target-Moderator-Reflector (TMR) -demonstrator of the proposed accelerator driven High Brilliance Neutron source (HBS) was set up with the Jülich Center of Neutron Science (JCNS). Beside showing the functionality of the TMR-Design the demonstrator gives the possibility to test new target materials, different types and concepts of moderators and at least the handling of irradiated targets and components. The TMR- target station is installed inside an Experimental area offering space for complex detector and component setups for nuclear and neutron related experiments like ToF-experiments or neutron imaging e.g. But it is used for other purposes like irradiation and electronic or detector tests as well. Additionally to the TMR, the extraction beamline from JULIC to the TMR was set up and equipped with a fast kicker and a 3-field permanent magnet, as foreseen in in HBS to deliver the beam to different target stations within a sophisticated pulsing scheme, synchronized with the beam pulsing done at JULIC, using fast deflection plates.

  {"id":"gingras__2016__bibliometrics_research_evaluation","abstract":"Why bibliometrics is useful for understanding the global dynamics of science but generate perverse effects when applied inappropriately in research evaluation and university rankings.\n            The research evaluation market is booming. “Ranking,” “metrics,” “h-index,” and “impact factors” are reigning buzzwords. Government and research administrators want to evaluate everything—teachers, professors, training programs, universities—using quantitative indicators. Among the tools used to measure “research excellence,” bibliometrics—aggregate data on publications and citations—has become dominant. Bibliometrics is hailed as an “objective” measure of research quality, a quantitative measure more useful than “subjective” and intuitive evaluation methods such as peer review that have been used since scientific papers were first published in the seventeenth century. In this book, Yves Gingras offers a spirited argument against an unquestioning reliance on bibliometrics as an indicator of research quality. Gingras shows that bibliometric rankings have no real scientific validity, rarely measuring what they pretend to.\n            Although the study of publication and citation patterns, at the proper scales, can yield insights on the global dynamics of science over time, ill-defined quantitative indicators often generate perverse and unintended effects on the direction of research. Moreover, abuse of bibliometrics occurs when data is manipulated to boost rankings. Gingras looks at the politics of evaluation and argues that using numbers can be a way to control scientists and diminish their autonomy in the evaluation process. Proposing precise criteria for establishing the validity of indicators at a given scale of analysis, Gingras questions why universities are so eager to let invalid indicators influence their research strategy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Gingras","given":"Yves"}],"citation-key":"gingras__2016__bibliometrics_research_evaluation","DOI":"10.7551/mitpress/10719.001.0001","ISBN":"978-0-262-33765-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",9,30]]},"keyword":"_used","language":"en","publisher":"The MIT Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Bibliometrics and research evaluation: uses and abuses","title-short":"Bibliometrics and research evaluation","type":"book","URL":"https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/4081/Bibliometrics-and-Research-EvaluationUses-and"},
  {"id":"girvan_newman__2002__community_structure_social","abstract":"A number of recent studies have focused on the statistical properties of networked systems such as social networks and the World-Wide Web. Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties which seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this paper, we highlight another property which is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly-knit groups between which there are only looser connections. We propose a new method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known, and find that it detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well-known - a collaboration network and a food web - and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Girvan","given":"Michelle"},{"family":"Newman","given":"M.

Particle accelerators for energy and intensity Frontier research in particle and nuclear physics continuously push the accelerator community to invent ways to increase the energy and improve the performance of accelerators, reduce their cost, and make them more power efficient. The accelerator community has demonstrated imagination and creativity in developing a plethora of future accelerator ideas and proposals. The technical maturity of the proposed facilities ranges from shovel-ready to those that are still largely conceptual. At this time, over 100 contributed papers have been submitted to the Accelerator Frontier of the US particle physics decadal community planning exercise known as Snowmass’2021. These papers cover a broad spectrum of topics: beam physics and accelerator education, accelerators for neutrinos, colliders for Electroweak/Higgs studies and multi-TeV energies, accelerators for Physics Beyond Colliders and rare processes, advanced accelerator concepts, and accelerator technology for Radio Frequency cavities (RF), magnets, targets and sources. This paper provides an overview of the present state of accelerators for particle physics and gives a brief description of some of the major facilities that have been proposed, their perceived advantages and some of the remaining challenges.","author":[{"family":"Gourlay","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Raubenheimer","given":"Tor"},{"family":"Shiltsev","given":"Vladimir"}],"citation-key":"gourlay_etal__2022__challenges_future_accelerators","container-title":"Frontiers in Physics","container-title-short":"Frontiers in Physics","DOI":"10.3389/fphy.2022.920520","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,1]]},"keyword":"#bf2035/application/science/high-energy-physics;_used","page":"920520","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Challenges of Future Accelerators for Particle Physics Research","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},

We developed an online questionnaire and collected the responses between September and November 2019; 126 responses were received. Most of them held a Ph.D. and identified themselves as males. Nearly all respondents worked exclusively in public institutions, and most were financially reliant on scholarships provided by public agencies. All of them studied at least one of the 81 dipteran families known to occur in Brazil, with most respondents working on families that included taxa of public health importance. Additionally, most work conducted by these researchers was rooted in systematics/taxonomy. A specific portion of the respondents (i.e., students) felt less integrated into the research community and found it challenging to publish high-impact research. However, some concerns were shared across all respondent subgroups, such as the need for increased funding and a more seamless integration within the research community. Academic professionals highlighted limited funding and inadequate infrastructure as barriers to research. Nevertheless, some subgroups expressed concerns about their career prospects. Although there may be limitations in the sampling process underpinning this study, our survey provides valuable insights into the demographic characteristics of Brazilian dipterist community, thus facilitating the development of policy strategies.\nKEY WORDS:\nBrazil; careers; demography; Diptera; funding; outreach","author":[{"family":"Haseyama","given":"Kirstern Lica"},{"family":"Shimabukuro","given":"Paloma"},{"family":"Kirst","given":"Frederico"},{"family":"Falaschi","given":"Rafaela"}],"citation-key":"haseyama_etal__2024__questionnaire_survey_brazilian","container-title":"Zoologia (Curitiba Impresso)","container-title-short":"Zoologia (Curitiba Impresso)","DOI":"10.1590/S1984-4689.v41.e23012","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,5]]},"keyword":"_used","page":"1","source":"ResearchGate","title":"A questionnaire survey of the Brazilian dipterological research Community","type":"article-journal","volume":"41"},

The paper presents a comparative study about the evolution of two innovation-related policies that share a common concept. This document-centric study relies on position papers, white papers, government documents, policy documents and research program descriptions. The paper establishes that the concreteness and sophistication of the TRL scale gradually diminished as its usage spread outside its original context (space programs). A discipline-specific tailoring of the scale is essential in every area before application. Yet for a number of disciplines this has not happened, while in some other areas the available customizations and handbooks are not used in EU context. This uncritical usage of the scale in the current EU framework program seems to carry more risks than advantages. In the absence of discipline-specific guides, TRLs will predictably become a source of confusion and a subject of abuse in efforts to obtain EU funding.","author":[{"family":"Héder","given":"Mihály"}],"citation-key":"heder__2017__nasa_eu_evolution","container-title":"The Innovation Journal: The Public Sector Innovation Journal","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"keyword":"#bf2035/terms/tlr;_used","language":"en","number":"2","title":"From NASA to EU: the evolution of the TRL scale in public sector innovation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.innovation.cc/discussion-papers/2017_22_2_3_heder_nasa-to-eu-trl-scale.pdf","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"klingner_etal__2023__research_data_management","abstract":"Science is changing: the volume and complexity of data are increasing, the number of studies is growing and the goal of achieving reproducible results requires new solutions for scientific data management. In the field of neuroscience, the German National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI-Neuro) initiative aims to develop sustainable solutions for research data management (RDM). To obtain an understanding of the present RDM situation in the neuroscience community, NFDI-Neuro conducted a comprehensive survey among the neuroscience community. Here, we report and analyze the results of the survey. We focused the survey and our analysis on current needs, challenges, and opinions about RDM. The German neuroscience community perceives barriers with respect to RDM and data sharing mainly linked to (1) lack of data and metadata standards, (2) lack of community adopted provenance tracking methods, (3) lack of secure and privacy preserving research infrastructure for sensitive data, (4) lack of RDM literacy, and (5) lack of resources (time, personnel, money) for proper RDM. However, an overwhelming majority of community members (91%) indicated that they would be willing to share their data with other researchers and are interested to increase their RDM skills. Taking advantage of this willingness and overcoming the existing barriers requires the systematic development of standards, tools, and infrastructure, the provision of training, education, and support, as well as additional resources for RDM to the research community and a constant dialogue with relevant stakeholders including policy makers to leverage of a culture change through adapted incentivization and regulation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Klingner","given":"Carsten M."},{"family":"Denker","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Grün","given":"Sonja"},{"family":"Hanke","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Oeltze-Jafra","given":"Steffen"},{"family":"Ohl","given":"Frank W."},{"family":"Radny","given":"Janina"},{"family":"Rotter","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Scherberger","given":"Hansjörg"},{"family":"Stein","given":"Alexandra"},{"family":"Wachtler","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Witte","given":"Otto W."},{"family":"Ritter","given":"Petra"}],"citation-key":"klingner_etal__2023__research_data_management","container-title":"eNeuro","container-title-short":"eNeuro","DOI":"10.1523/ENEURO.0215-22.2023","ISSN":"2373-2822","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,1]]},"keyword":"#bf2035/issue/community-management;_used","language":"en","license":"Copyright © 2023 Klingner et al..

  {"id":"krishna__2023__awake_introduces_stronger","abstract":"“Plasma wakefield acceleration is like surfing,” says Edda Gschwendtner, leader of the AWAKE accelerator R&D project at CERN. AWAKE is all set to begin its second phase of data taking on 31 July – with a brand-new plasma source. While various future collider proposals aim to increase the size of an accelerator to increase the energy of the particles, AWAKE would help to figure out the opposite: how to shrink the size of a particle accelerator while still achieving higher energies, using a new way of accelerating particles. “Imagine a boat on a lake and surfers waiting for a wave. The boat passes by the surfers and creates waves, the surfers jump on the wave and also get accelerated. We do the same in plasma wakefield acceleration. We have plasma (the lake) in which the beam (the boat) drives waves, and then we inject particles (surfers) on the waves to get accelerated,” explains Gschwendtner in her TEDxCERN talk. A plasma wakefield is a type of wave generated by particles travelling through a plasma. AWAKE sends proton beams from the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) through plasma cells to generate these fields. A second beam – the “witness” electron beam (the surfers) – is then accelerated by the wakefields, gaining up to several gigavolts of energy. Striving to demonstrate the benefits of plasma wakefield acceleration over conventional technologies such as radiofrequency cavities, AWAKE has implemented new plasma-source prototypes and approaches.   AWAKE’s new rubidium vapour plasma source is 10 metres long, similar to that used in previous runs, but this time it introduces a density step that allows stronger wakefields to be obtained. This new plasma source is split into segments whose temperature can be controlled independently along its entire length. AWAKE's new plasma source based on rubidium vapour introduces a density step that allows to get stronger wakefields. (Image: CERN) The old plasma source was removed from the tunnel a few months ago to welcome the upgraded version, which was developed jointly by the Max Planck Institute for Physics in Munich, Germany and Wright Design in the UK. This also offered a unique opportunity to test another prototype: the discharge plasma source, developed by IST-Lisbon in Portugal and the Vacuum, Surfaces and Coatings group at CERN. The discharge plasma source is a potential candidate for AWAKE’s operation after CERN’s third long shutdown. It has the potential to be scaled up beyond 10 metres to achieve multi-stage acceleration like in conventional accelerators, while remaining considerably shorter overall. “The longer the plasma source, the higher the energy of the witness beam would be,” says Alban Sublet, an applied physicist in the Vacuum, Surfaces and Coatings group, on the advantage of a scalable plasma source. “We managed to perform a variety of measurements during the test with the discharge plasma source, for example we investigated how different gases such as helium or xenon, different gas pressures and different plasma lengths affect the proton beam and the wakefields.” Both the rubidium vapour source and the discharge plasma source aim to achieve the same properties of the plasma but in different ways: by laser ionisation for the rubidium source and by pulsed direct current (DC) discharge in different gases for the discharge plasma source. Thanks to its clear scientific roadmap, AWAKE has already come a long way and is looking ahead to its first particle physics applications for the next decade. “The AWAKE experiment started in 2016 and the first two years were proof of concept. We managed to show that indeed we can use the proton beam from the SPS to drive the wakefield in a 10-metre-long plasma source. We also managed to accelerate electrons already to a very high energy. We were very happy about that,” says Gschwendtner. “Now we are moving on to the next phase in the experiment, in which we want to demonstrate that we can accelerate electrons to high energies and control the beam quality. This is very important because this is what we need for a real accelerator for particle physics applications.” Watch CERN's latest Youtube video to find out more about AWAKE.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Krishna","given":"Chetna"}],"citation-key":"krishna__2023__awake_introduces_stronger","container-title":"CERN","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,27]]},"keyword":"_used;#befide/accelerating-process/plasma-based-acceleration/plasma-based_beam-driven_acceleration;#befide/accelerator-based-facility/:awake","language":"en","title":"AWAKE introduces a stronger wave to accelerate particles","type":"webpage","URL":"https://home.cern/news/news/accelerators/awake-introduces-stronger-wave-accelerate-particles"},

  {"id":"kumar_etal____science_technology_ontology","abstract":"Ontologies play a critical role in Semantic Web technologies by providing a structured and standardized way to represent knowledge and enabling machines to understand the meaning of data. Several taxonomies and ontologies have been generated, but individuals target one domain, and only some of those have been found expensive in time and manual effort. Also, they need more coverage of unconventional topics representing a more holistic and comprehensive view of the knowledge landscape and interdisciplinary collaborations. Thus, there needs to be an ontology covering Science and Technology and facilitate multidisciplinary research by connecting topics from different fields and domains that may be related or have commonalities. To address these issues, we present an automatic Science and Technology Ontology (S&TO) that covers unconventional topics in different science and technology domains. The proposed S&TO can promote the discovery of new research areas and collaborations across disciplines. The ontology is constructed by applying BERTopic to a dataset of 393,991 scientific articles collected from Semantic Scholar from October 2021 to August 2022, covering four fields of science. Currently, S&TO includes 5,153 topics and 13,155 semantic relations.

  {"id":"lalli_etal__2019__dynamics_collaboration_networks","abstract":"This paper presents a novel methodology for defining and analyzing the dynamics of the collaboration networks of scientists working on general relativity from the mid-1920s-1970. During these four and a half decades the status of the theory underwent a radical transformation: from a marginal theory before the mid-1950s to a pillar of modern physics. To investigate this passage-known as the renaissance of general relativity-we used a definition of collaboration networks broader than the co-authorship relations retriev-able from online datasets. We constructed a multilayer network, in which each layer represents a different kind of collaboration. After having analyzed the evolution over time of specific parameters of the co-authorship network, we investigated the effects of adding one type of collaboration edge at a time, in a cumulative fashion, on the values of these parameters and on the topology of the collaboration network through time, including rapid shifts in the dynamic evolution of the largest component. This analysis provides robust quantitative evidence that a shift in the structure of the relativity collaboration network occurred between the late 1950s and the early 1960s, when a giant component started forming. We interpret this shift as the central social dynamic of the renaissance process and then identify its central actors. Our analysis disproves common explanations of the renaissance process. It shows that this phenomenon was not a consequence of astrophysical discoveries in the 1960s, nor was it a simple by-product of socioeconomic transformations in the physics landscape after World War II.","author":[{"family":"Lalli","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Howey","given":"Riaz"},{"family":"Wintergrün","given":"Dirk"}],"citation-key":"lalli_etal__2019__dynamics_collaboration_networks","container-title":"Scientometrics","container-title-short":"Scientometrics","DOI":"10.1007/s11192-019-03327-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,16]]},"keyword":"#bf2035/issue/excellence/bibliometrics;#bf2035/issue/collaboration;_used","source":"ResearchGate","title":"The dynamics of collaboration networks and the history of general relativity, 1925-1970","type":"article-journal","volume":"121"},

  {"id":"mankins__2009__technology_readiness_assessments","abstract":"The development of new system capabilities typically depends upon the prior success of advanced technology research and development efforts. These systems developments inevitably face the three major challenges of any project: performance, schedule and budget. Done well, advanced technology programs can substantially reduce the uncertainty in all three of these dimensions of project management. Done poorly, or not at all, and new system developments suffer from cost overruns, schedule delays and the steady erosion of initial performance objectives. It is often critical for senior management to be able to determine which of these two paths is more likely—and to respond accordingly. The challenge for system and technology managers is to be able to make clear, well-documented assessments of technology readiness and risks, and to do so at key points in the life cycle of the program. In the mid 1970s, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) introduced the concept of “technology readiness levels” (TRLs) as a discipline-independent, programmatic ﬁgure of merit (FOM) to allow more effective assessment of, and communication regarding the maturity of new technologies. In 1995, the TRL scale was further strengthened by the articulation of the ﬁrst deﬁnitions of each level, along with examples (J. Mankins, Technology readiness levels, A White Paper, NASA, Washington, DC, 1995. [1]). Since then, TRLs have been embraced by the U.S. Congress’ General Accountability Ofﬁce (GAO), adopted by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), and are being considered for use by numerous other organizations. Overall, the TRLs have proved to be highly effective in communicating the status of new technologies among sometimes diverse organizations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Mankins","given":"John C."}],"citation-key":"mankins__2009__technology_readiness_assessments","container-title":"Acta Astronautica","container-title-short":"Acta Astronautica","DOI":"10.1016/j.actaastro.2009.03.058","ISSN":"00945765","issue":"9-10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",11]]},"keyword":"#bf2035/terms/tlr;_used","language":"en","number":"9-10","page":"1216-1223","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Technology readiness assessments: a retrospective","title-short":"Technology readiness assessments","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0094576509002008","volume":"65"},

  {"id":"metral_etal__2020__impedance_collective_effects","abstract":"Abstract\n            As the beam intensity increases, the beam can no longer be considered as a collection of non-interacting single particles: in addition to the “single-particle phenomena”, “collective effects” become significant. At low intensity a beam of charged particles moves around an accelerator under the Lorentz force produced by the “external” electromagnetic fields (from the guiding and focusing magnets, RF cavities, etc.). However, the charged particles also interact with themselves (leading to space charge effects) and with their environment, inducing charges and currents in the surrounding structures, which create electromagnetic fields called wake fields. In the ultra-relativistic limit, causality dictates that there can be no electromagnetic field in front of the beam, which explains the term “wake”. It is often useful to examine the frequency content of the wake field (a time domain quantity) by performing a Fourier transformation on it. This leads to the concept of impedance (a frequency domain quantity), which is a complex function of frequency. The charged particles can also interact with other charged particles present in the accelerator (leading to two-stream effects, and in particular to electron cloud effects in positron/hadron machines) and with the counter-rotating beam in a collider (leading to beam–beam effects). As the beam intensity increases, all these “perturbations” should be properly quantified and the motion of the charged particles will eventually still be governed by the Lorentz force but using the total electromagnetic fields, which are the sum of the external and perturbation fields. Note that in some cases a perturbative treatment is not sufficient and the problem has to be solved self consistently. These perturbations can lead to both incoherent (i.e. of a single particle) and coherent (i.e. of the centre of mass) effects, in the longitudinal and in one or both transverse directions, leading to beam quality degradation or even partial or total beam losses. Fortunately, stabilising mechanisms exist, such as Landau damping, electronic feedback systems and linear coupling between the transverse planes (as in the case of a transverse coherent instability, one plane is usually more critical than the other).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Metral","given":"E."},{"family":"Rumolo","given":"G."},{"family":"Herr","given":"W."}],"citation-key":"metral_etal__2020__impedance_collective_effects","container-title":"Particle Physics Reference Library","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-34245-6_4","editor":[{"family":"Myers","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Schopper","given":"Herwig"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-030-34244-9 978-3-030-34245-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"keyword":"_used","language":"en","page":"105-181","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Impedance and collective effects","type":"chapter","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-030-34245-6_4"},

  {"id":"moller_etal__2016__assessing_effects_german","abstract":"The German Excellence Initiative started in 2006 as a public funding program of crucial importance for German universities. Since this time, several studies on different aspects of the program have been conducted, but there have been no analyses using bibliometric methods to measure the direct effects of funding—which is apparently due to the fact that publications resulting from the funding program are not publicly and comprehensively documented. This paper uses the concept of highly cited publications to measure excellent research, and explores two methodological approaches in order to attribute highly cited publications to the Excellence Initiative. To this end, the paper focuses on publications produced by the clusters of excellence (CoEs). The clusters of excellence constitute only one of three funding lines, but receive 60 % of the total funding of the excellence program and form the core research units of the Excellence Initiative. The highly cited publications of the CoEs are identiﬁed via self-selected lists of publications in the CoE renewal proposals and via a funding acknowledgement analysis. The validity of both data sources is analyzed comparatively. Based on the objectives of the Excellence Initiative, its effects on the level of funded clusters, universities and the overall German research system are explored. The bibliometric analysis gives evidence that the funding program has succeeded in concentrating excellent research and fostering collaborations between universities and the non-university research sector, but has not caused massive changes to the overall German research system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Möller","given":"Torger"},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Marion"},{"family":"Hornbostel","given":"Stefan"}],"citation-key":"moller_etal__2016__assessing_effects_german","container-title":"Scientometrics","container-title-short":"Scientometrics","DOI":"10.1007/s11192-016-2090-3","ISSN":"0138-9130, 1588-2861","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",12]]},"keyword":"#bf2035/issue/excellence;#bf2035/issue/excellence/bibliometrics;_used","language":"en","note":"30 citations (Crossref) [2024-01-04]","page":"2217-2239","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Assessing the effects of the German Excellence Initiative with bibliometric methods","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11192-016-2090-3","volume":"109"},
  {"id":"moller_hornbostel__2023__long_winding_road","abstract":"A pioneering collection of case studies on the global phenomenon of academic excellence initiatives and how they shape the performance of research universities.\nAcademic excellence initiatives (AEIs)—special government-sponsored programs to improve research universities—have provided billions of dollars to top universities and represent perhaps the most significant effort in the past half-century to jump-start academic research. The contributors to Academic Star Wars, superbly edited by Maria Yudkevich, Philip G. Altbach, and Jamil Salmi, analyze AEIs in nine European and Asian countries, including China, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, Denmark, France, Germany, and Russia, and offer penetrating insights into the successes and problems of these initiatives, as well as into the broader system of higher education itself.\nAcademic Star Wars provides a comprehensive analysis of AEIs across the globe as it seeks to understand the impact of these programs on national higher ed systems. The contributors explore a host of topics, including how the idea of excellence varies across national systems; the lessons to be drawn from the most successful AEIs; the consequences of AEIs, both intended and unintended, for participating universities; and whether AEIs ensure a significant impact on the global standing of national higher education systems. Finally, the contributors offer policy recommendations for national decision-makers and university leaders, taking into account the variety of initial conditions of national higher education systems and the differences in AEI design, scope, and funding.","author":[{"family":"Möller","given":"Torger"},{"family":"Hornbostel","given":"Stefan"}],"citation-key":"moller_hornbostel__2023__long_winding_road","DOI":"10.7551/mitpress/14601.003.0012","ISBN":"978-0-262-37669-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,5]]},"keyword":"#bf2035/issue/excellence;_used","page":"177-202","source":"ResearchGate","title":"The Long and Winding Road to Excellence: The German Case","title-short":"The Long and Winding Road to Excellence","type":"chapter"},

  {"id":"olechnicka_etal__2018__geography_scientific_collaboration","abstract":"Science is increasingly defined by multidimensional collaborative networks. Despite the unprecedented growth of scientific collaboration around the globe—the collaborative turn—geography still matters for the cognitive enterprise. The spatial location and distance between scholars and research organisations affect their likelihood to collaborate and to achieve results that expand the knowledge frontier. At the same time, the developmental prospects of cities, regions, and countries result from, and depend on, their place in the global network of research collaboration.\n\nThis book explores how geography conditions scientific collaboration and how collaboration affects the spatiality of science. Addressing these questions requires the reconstruction of historical developments that led to the collaborative turn in science, the examination of mutual relations between science and places, and the analysis of spatial patterns of research collaboration at various levels: from individual to global. By combining a vast array of approaches, concepts, and methodologies, the volume offers a comprehensive theoretical framework for the geography of scientific collaboration.\n\nThe momentous role of collaboration for contemporary science implies that understanding the processes and patterns of research collaboration is now essential, not only for scholars interested in science studies, but also for policymakers and managers of research organisations. Those more practically oriented readers may be particularly attracted by the case studies of scientific collaboration policies from the European Union, the United States, and China, as well as the catalogue of tools for scientific collaboration policy.","author":[{"family":"Olechnicka","given":"Agnieszka"},{"family":"Ploszaj","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Celińska-Janowicz","given":"Dorota"}],"citation-key":"olechnicka_etal__2018__geography_scientific_collaboration","ISBN":"978-1-138-20333-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,22]]},"keyword":"#bf2035/issue/excellence/bibliometrics;#bf2035/issue/collaboration;_used","source":"ResearchGate","title":"The Geography of Scientific Collaboration","type":"book"},

This is an instrument designed to encourage outstanding research by providing large-scale, long-term funding to designated research units. They provide funds for research and research-related measures, such as the improvement or extension of physical infrastructure, the recruitment of outstanding researchers from abroad and researcher training. This report presents new evidence on how governments steer and fund public research in higher education and public research institutions through REIs. The report can help inform discussions on future government policy directions by providing information on how REIs work and on the functioning and characteristics of institutions that host centres of excellence.

Combination of a compact storage ring and a laser wake-field accelerator (LWFA) might be the basis for future compact light sources and advancing user facilities. Meanwhile the post-LWFA beam is not fitted for storage and accumulation in conventional storage rings. New generation rings with adapted features are required. Different geometries and lattices of a ring operating between 50 to 500 MeV energy range were investigated. The model suitable to store the post-LWFA beam with a wide momentum spread (1% to 2%) and ultra-short electron bunches of fs range was chosen as basis for further detailed studies. The DBA-FDF lattice with relaxed settings, split elements and high order optics of tolerable strength allows improving the dynamic aperture up to 20 mm. The momentum acceptance of the compact lattice exceeds 8% while dispersion is limited.

  {"id":"podlech_etal__2019__conceptual_design_proton","abstract":"Due to the decommissioning of several research reactors there will be a severe drop in available neutrons for research in Europe in the next decade despite the commissioning of the European Spallation Source (ESS). Compact accelerator-based neutron sources (CANS) could close this gap. The High Brilliance Neutron Source (HBS) currently under development at Forschungszentrum Jülich is scalable in terms of beam energy and power due to its modular design. The driver Linac for HBS at will accelerate a 100 mA proton beam to 70 MeV. The Linac is operated with a beam duty cycle of up to 6% (11% RF duty cycle) and can simultaneously deliver three proton pulse lengths (384 Hz@52 mu-s, 96 Hz@208 mu-s and 24 Hz@832 mu-s) for three neutron production targets. In order to minimize the development effort and the technological risk, state-of-the-art technology of the MYRRHA injector is used. The front end of the HBS Linac consists of an ECR source, LEBT and a 2.5 MeV RFQ followed by a CH-DTL with 35 room temperature CH-cavities. All RF structures are operated at 176.1 MHz and are designed for high duty cycle. Solid-state amplifiers up to 500 kW are used as RF drivers. Due to the beam current and the high average beam power of up to 420 kW, particular attention is paid to beam dynamics. In order to minimize losses, a quasi-periodic lattice with constant negative phase is used. The contribution describes the conceptual design and the challenges of such a modern high power proton accelerator with high reliability and availability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Podlech","given":"Holger"},{"family":"Baggemann","given":"Johannes"},{"family":"Brückel","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Böhm","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Cronert","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Doege","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Droba","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Gutberlet","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Kümpel","given":"Klaus"},{"family":"Lamprecht","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jingjing"},{"family":"Mauerhofer","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Meusel","given":"Oliver"},{"family":"Petry","given":"Nils"},{"family":"Rücker","given":"Ulrich"},{"family":"Schneider","given":"Philipp"},{"family":"Schwarz","given":"Malte"},{"family":"Zakalek","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Chuan"}],"citation-key":"podlech_etal__2019__conceptual_design_proton","container-title":"Proceedings of the 10th Int.

Typically, increased performance - higher beam energies and intensities - of proposed new facilities have come with increased electric power consumption. In the following we discuss the most important areas of development for the sustainability of accelerator-based research infrastructures in three categories - technologies, concepts and general aspects. To achieve the goal of increased performance with reduced energy consumption a focused R&D effort is required with the same or even higher priority as the traditional performance-related R&D.

  {"id":"rossi_senatore__2021__hts_accelerator_magnet","abstract":"In view of the preparation for a post-LHC collider, in 2010 the high-energy physics (HEP) community started to discuss various options, including the use of HTS for very high-field dipoles. Therefore, a small program was begun in Europe that aimed at exploring the possibility of using HTS for accelerator-quality magnets. Based on various EU-funded programs, though at modest levels, it has enabled the European community of accelerator magnet research to start getting experience in HTS and address a few issues. The program was based on the use of REBa2Cu3O7−x (REBCO) tapes to form 10 kA Roebel cables to wind small dipoles of 30–40 mm aperture in the 5 T range. The dipoles are designed to be later inserted in a background dipole field (in Nb3Sn), to reach eventually a field level in the 16–20 T range, beyond the reach of Low Temperature Superconductors (LTS). The program is currently underway: more than 1 km of high-performance tape (Je > 500 A/mm2 at 20 T, 4.2 K) has been manufactured and characterized, various 30 m long Roebel cables have been assembled and validated up to 13 kA, a few dipoles have been wound and tested, reaching 4.5 T in stand-alone (while a dipole made from flat race track coils exceeded 5 T using stacked tape cable), and tests in background field are being organized.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Rossi","given":"Lucio"},{"family":"Senatore","given":"Carmine"}],"citation-key":"rossi_senatore__2021__hts_accelerator_magnet","container-title":"Instruments","container-title-short":"Instruments","DOI":"10/gpcwzz","ISSN":"2410-390X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,23]]},"keyword":"_used","language":"en","note":"https://web.archive.org/web/20220206093607/https://www.mdpi.com/2410-390X/5/1/8","page":"8","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"HTS Accelerator Magnet and Conductor Development in Europe","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2410-390X/5/1/8","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"salatino_etal__2018__computer_science_ontology","abstract":"Ontologies of research areas are important tools for characterising, exploring, and analysing the research landscape. Some fields of research are comprehensively described by large-scale taxonomies, e.g., MeSH in Biology and PhySH in Physics. Conversely, current Computer Science taxonomies are coarse-grained and tend to evolve slowly. For instance, the ACM classification scheme contains only about 2K research topics and the last version dates back to 2012. In this paper, we introduce the Computer Science Ontology (CSO), a large-scale, automatically generated ontology of research areas, which includes about 26K topics and 226K semantic relationships. It was created by applying the Klink-2 algorithm on a very large dataset of 16M scientific articles. CSO presents two main advantages over the alternatives: (i) it includes a very large number of topics that do not appear in other classifications, and (ii) it can be updated automatically by running Klink-2 on recent corpora of publications. CSO powers several tools adopted by the editorial team at Springer Nature and has been used to enable a variety of solutions, such as classifying research publications, detecting research communities, and predicting research trends. To facilitate the uptake of CSO we have developed the CSO Portal, a web application that enables users to download, explore, and provide granular feedback on CSO at different levels. Users can use the portal to rate topics and relationships, suggest missing relationships, and visualise sections of the ontology. The portal will support the publication of and access to regular new releases of CSO, with the aim of providing a comprehensive resource to the various communities engaged with scholarly data.","author":[{"family":"Salatino","given":"Angelo A."},{"family":"Thanapalasingam","given":"Thiviyan"},{"family":"Mannocci","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Osborne","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Motta","given":"Enrico"}],"citation-key":"salatino_etal__2018__computer_science_ontology","container-title":"The Semantic Web – ISWC 2018","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-00668-6_12","editor":[{"family":"Vrandečić","given":"Denny"},{"family":"Bontcheva","given":"Kalina"},{"family":"Suárez-Figueroa","given":"Mari Carmen"},{"family":"Presutti","given":"Valentina"},{"family":"Celino","given":"Irene"},{"family":"Sabou","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Kaffee","given":"Lucie-Aimée"},{"family":"Simperl","given":"Elena"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-030-00668-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"keyword":"_used","language":"en","page":"187-205","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"The computer science ontology: a large-scale taxonomy of research areas","title-short":"The computer science ontology","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"sanders_etal__2020__reform_strategy_germany","abstract":"In this chapter, we outline a reform strategy to promote a more entrepreneurial society in Germany. Germany has developed a successful model of capitalism in which high productivity growth is driven by on-the-job learning and firm-specific skill accumulation. The economy is rooted in a strong and regionally embedded Mittelstand, which supports an export-oriented industry mainly based on incremental innovations, but which is less conducive to more radical innovation. We, therefore, suggest a reform agenda for Germany that encourages more entrepreneurial experimentation with the aim of facilitating radical innovation, both in incumbent and new firms. Germany’s entrepreneurial talent should be encouraged to take on more risk, the education system could promote initiative, creativity and a willingness to experiment, and a more equal playing field between dependent employment and self-employment/employer could be created.","author":[{"family":"Sanders","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Stenkula","given":"Mikael"},{"family":"Fritsch","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Herrmann","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Latifi","given":"Gresa"},{"family":"Páger","given":"Balázs"},{"family":"Szerb","given":"László"},{"family":"Terragno","given":"Elisa"},{"family":"Wyrwich","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"sanders_etal__2020__reform_strategy_germany","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-662-61007-7_7","ISBN":"978-3-662-61006-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,4]]},"keyword":"#bf2035/issue/commercialisation;#bf2035/issue/commercialisation/entrepreneurship;_used","page":"163-202","source":"ResearchGate","title":"A Reform Strategy for Germany","type":"chapter"},

Laser-plasma accelerators also intrinsically accelerate short particle bunches, several orders of magnitude shorter than that of conventional technology, which leads to reductions in beamstrahlung and, hence, savings in the overall power consumption to reach a desired luminosity. These properties make laser-plasma accelerators a promising accelerator technology for a more compact, less expensive high-energy linear collider providing multi-TeV polarized leptons. In this submission to the Snowmass 2021 Accelerator Frontier, we discuss the motivation for a laser-plasma-accelerator-based linear collider, the status of the field, and potential linear collider concepts up to 15 TeV. We outline the research and development path toward a collider based on laser-plasma accelerator technology, and highlight near-term and mid-term applications of this technology on the collider development path.

The energy efficiency of this conversion process can be optimized using efficient technologies, but also with optimal concepts for entire facilities.","author":[{"family":"Seidel","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"seidel__2024__energyefficient_particle_accelerators","DOI":"10.1093/acrefore/9780190871994.013.137","ISBN":"978-0-19-087199-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,20]]},"keyword":"#bf2035/issue/green-transformation;_used","language":"en","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Energy-efficient particle accelerators for research","type":"chapter"},

  {"id":"shiltsev__2014__phenomenological_cost_model","abstract":"Accelerator-based facilities have enabled forefront research in high-energy physics for more than half a century. The accelerator technology of colliders has progressed immensely, while beam energy, luminosity, facility size, and cost have grown by several orders of magnitude. The method of colliding beams has not fully exhausted its potential but has slowed down considerably in its progress. In this paper we derive a simple scaling model for the cost of large accelerators and colliding beam facilities based on costs of 17 big facilities which have been either built or carefully estimated. Although this approach cannot replace an actual cost estimate based on an engineering design, this parameterization is to indicate a somewhat realistic cost range for consideration of what future frontier accelerator facilities might be fiscally realizable.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Shiltsev","given":"V."}],"citation-key":"shiltsev__2014__phenomenological_cost_model","container-title-short":"J.

At present the near term US, European and international strategies of the particle physics community are centered on full exploitation of the physics potential of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) through its high-luminosity upgrade (HL-LHC). A number of next generation collider facilities have been proposed and are currently under consideration for the medium- and far-future of the accelerator-based high energy physics. In this paper we offer a uniform approach to evaluation of various accelerators based on the feasibility of their energy reach, performance reach and cost range. We briefly review such post-LHC options as linear e+e- colliders in Japan (ILC) or at CERN (CLIC), muon collider, and circular lepton or hadron colliders in China (CepC/SppC) and Europe (FCC).

  {"id":"stahlschmidt_etal__2019__performance_structures_german","abstract":"This study updates the annual analysis of the performance and structures of the German Science System in international comparison. Bibliometric indicators are presented and discussed for the period 2007-2017. In addition, a comparison between the two major data sources used for bibliometric analysis, Web of Science and Scopus, is presented in order to assess the impact the choice of the data source has on the performance indicators. Both data sources differ in their selection philosophy. While Elsevier intends for Scopus to be the largest database, Clarivate Analytics is confident that capturing high-quality journals offers sufficient data to be representative of each discipline. In general, the differing business philosophies result in differences in the thresholds at which the inclusion criteria for indexation are applied. This subsequently affects the coverage of the databases. Due to the higher number of journals and other sources covered in Scopus compared to Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science (WoS) the overall number of publications and their citations are typically higher in Scopus. Reacting to the ongoing debate of the appropriateness of the selective approach Clarivate Analytics pursues it recently introduced a new index, the Emerging Sources Index (ESCI), which, while making concessions with regard to the selection criteria, extends the coverage significantly. The ESCI sought to improve regional and field-specific coverage; however, to date neither the bias towards publications from Europe and North America nor the over-represention of the natural and medical sciences and under representation of the arts and humanities has been solved. Which also holds true for Scopus. Both databases use a journal-based classification system, meaning that not the individual article but, the whole journal is assigned to a category. Overall, the Web of Science seems to perform significantly better than Scopus in terms of the accuracy of assigning journals to classification categories, which might affect field-normalised scores. Overall, we observe an increasing number of publication between 2007 and 2017 for most countries. This increase is due to increased publication output as such but also reflects the increased coverage of journals by WoS and Scopus. The growth is particularly countries like China and India and other countries with developing science systems such as South Africa, South Korea and Brazil. While for countries with well-established systems such as the USA, the UK, Germany and France growth rates are rather low resulting also in their decreasing publication shares. China and the USA continue to be the countries producing the highest number of publications. Germany maintained its standing as one of countries producing the highest number of publications, and publications of high quality. Compared to 2007, Germany is publishing in journals with greater international visibility, but receiving fewer citations in those journals. With regard to the Excellence Rate Germany’s position is rather stable above the threshold. China continues to improve its performance also with regard to this indicator and meanwhile almost reaching the expected value. Difference in indicator values such as Excellence Rates and proportions of uncited publications between both databases (both higher in Scopus than WoS) are due to Scopus’ inclusion of journals of lesser visibility compared to those in WoS. In general, the patterns observed in high- and low-performing countries was largely the same across the databases, despite the differences in figures. Unbowed is the overall trend towards increasing co-authorship, reflecting increasing collaboration. Also for Germany, the proportion of publications with international collaboration has increased. Switzerland remains the country with the highest share of internationally co-authored papers. As observed in the past, international co-authorship is particular high in smaller countries like Belgium or the Nordic countries. The USA remain the most attractive partner for most countries. Obvious is – from an US-America\n\n2 perspective - the strong increase of the share of publications co-authored between the USA and China reflecting increasing collaborations between these two countries, while the share of co-authored publications with other countries remains mainly stable. Looking at the different actors within Germany shows an upward trend in publications over time, which corresponds to the overall growing number of publication for Germany as whole. We observe slight changes when it comes to the performance of the sectors: the Helmholtz Association continues to produce the highest number of publications followed by the Max-Planck Society, which, however, produced fewer publications annually since 2012 and consequently its share of German publications dropped. An increasing share, though still at a low level can be observed for the Fachhochschulen. They doubled the number of their publications as well as their share of German publications over the reference period. Indicators also reflect that Fachhochschulen and each of the research associations are increasingly publishing in more highly-cited journals though their publications in these journals are receiving relatively fewer citations.","author":[{"family":"Stahlschmidt","given":"Stephan"},{"family":"Stephen","given":"Dimity"},{"family":"Hinze","given":"Sybille"}],"citation-key":"stahlschmidt_etal__2019__performance_structures_german","collection-title":"Studien zum deutschen Innovationssystem","event-place":"Berlin","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"keyword":"#bf2035/issue/excellence;#bf2035/issue/excellence/bibliometrics;_used","language":"en","number":"5-2019","page":"14","publisher":"Expertenkommission Forschung und Innovation (EFI)","publisher-place":"Berlin","source":"Zotero","title":"Performance and Structures of the German Science System","type":"report"},

  {"id":"thefcccollaboration_etal__2019__helhc_highenergy_large","abstract":"Abstract. Inresponsetothe2013UpdateoftheEuropeanStrategyfor Particle Physics (EPPSU), the Future Circular Collider (FCC) study was launched as a world-wide international collaboration hosted by CERN. The FCC study covered an energy-frontier hadron collider (FCC-hh), a highest-luminosity high-energy lepton collider (FCC-ee), the corresponding 100 km tunnel infrastructure, as well as the physics opportunities of these two colliders, and a high-energy LHC, based on FCC-hh technology. This document constitutes the fourth volume of the FCC Conceptual Design Report, devoted to the High-Energy Large Hadron Collider HE-LHC. It summarizes the HE-LHC physics discovery opportunities, presents the HE-LHC accelerator design, per- formance reach, and operation plan, discusses the underlying tech- nologies, the civil engineering and technical infrastructure, and also sketches a possible implementation. Combining ingredients from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the high-luminosity LHC upgrade and adding novel technologies and approaches, the HE-LHC design aims at a hadron collider with about twice the centre-of-mass collision energy that the LHC can reach. Its performance aims at exploring physics beyond the Standard Model, significantly extending the LHC’s direct and indirect sensitivity to new physics and discoveries.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,25]]},"author":[{"literal":"the FCC Collaboration"},{"family":"Abada","given":"A."},{"family":"Abbrescia","given":"M."},{"family":"AbdusSalam","given":"S.

Bibliometrics allows us to assess the growth and development of the field and provides an overview of the most relevant sources, authors, and institutions in the chosen field. Additionally, keyword analysis can be performed to provide details that could aid in identifying research trends and hot topics. Indeed, bibliometrics allows for identifying the basic and dominant themes and trends, as well as those emerging or declining. The aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of the current status and trends in scientific literature in the PT field. The analysis will give an overview of past scientific production and, most importantly, provide a useful point of view on the future directions of the research activities.\n\nAbstract\nBackground: The therapeutic potential of proton therapy (PT) was first recognized in 1946 by Robert Wilson, and nowadays, over 100 proton centers are in operation worldwide, and more than 60 are under construction or planned. Bibliometric data can be used to perform a structured analysis of large amounts of scientific data to provide new insights, e.g., to assess the growth and development of the field and to identify research trends and hot topics. The aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of the current status and trends in scientific literature in the PT field. Methods: The literature on PT until the 31st December 2022 in the Scopus database was searched, including the following keywords: proton AND radiotherapy AND cancer/tumor in title, abstract, and/or keywords. The open-source R Studio’s Bibliometrix package and Biblioshiny software (version 2.0) were used to perform the analysis. Results: A total of 7335 documents, mainly articles (n = 4794, 65%) and reviews (n = 1527, 21%), were collected from 1946 to 2022 from 1054 sources and 21,696 authors. Of these, roughly 84% (n = 6167) were produced in the last 15 years (2008–2022), in which the mean annual growth rate was 13%. Considering the corresponding author’s country, 79 countries contributed to the literature; the USA was the top contributor, with 2765 (38%) documents, of whom 84% were single-country publications (SCP), followed by Germany and Japan, with 535 and 531 documents of whom 66% and 93% were SCP. Considering the themes subanalysis (2002–2022), a total of 7192 documents were analyzed; among all keywords used by authors, the top three were radiotherapy (n = 1394, 21% of documents), intensity-modulated radiotherapy (n = 301, 5%), and prostate cancer (n = 301, 5%). Among disease types, prostate cancer is followed by chordoma, head and neck, and breast cancer. The change in trend themes demonstrated the fast evolution of hotspots in PT; among the most recent trends, the appearance of flash, radiomics, relative biological effectiveness (RBE), and linear energy transfer (LET) deserve to be highlighted. Conclusions: The results of the present bibliometric analysis showed that PT is an active and rapidly increasing field of research. Themes of the published works encompass the main aspects of its application in clinical practice, such as the comparison with the actual photon-based standard of care technique and the continuing technological advances. This analysis gives an overview of past scientific production and, most importantly, provides a useful point of view on the future directions of the research activities.","author":[{"family":"Vincini","given":"Maria Giulia"},{"family":"Zaffaroni","given":"Mattia"},{"family":"Schwarz","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Marvaso","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Mastroleo","given":"Federico"},{"family":"Volpe","given":"Stefania"},{"family":"Bergamaschi","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Mazzola","given":"Giovanni"},{"family":"Corrao","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Orecchia","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Jereczek-Fossa","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Alterio","given":"Daniela"}],"citation-key":"vincini_etal__2023__more_five_decades","container-title":"Cancers","container-title-short":"Cancers","DOI":"10.3390/cancers15235545","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,23]]},"keyword":"#bf2035/application/health/proton-therapy;#bf2035/application/health;#bf2035/issue/excellence/bibliometrics;_used","page":"5545","source":"ResearchGate","title":"More than Five Decades of Proton Therapy: A Bibliometric Overview of the Scientific Literature","title-short":"More than Five Decades of Proton Therapy","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"wanzenberg_etal__2019__design_status_ultralow","abstract":"At DESY the Synchrotron Light Source PETRA III oﬀers scientists outstanding opportunities for experiments with hard X-rays of exceptionally high brilliance since 2009. Research activities have been started to upgrade PETRA III to the ultra-low emittance source PETRA IV, which will be diﬀraction limited up to the hard X-ray range. Therefore the future light source PETRA IV will be ideal for 3D X-ray microscopy of biological, chemical, and physical processes under realistic conditions at length scales from atomic dimensions to millimeters. The lattice design is aiming for a horizontal emittance in the range between 10 pm rad and 30 pm rad at a beam energy of 6 GeV. Presently, two diﬀerent approaches are considered for the lattice design: a design based on a hybrid multibend achromat with an interleaved sextupole conﬁguration based on the ESRF-EBS design, and a lattice with a double non-interleaved sextupole conﬁguration. The current status of the design activities is reported including the injector and several technical aspects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Wanzenberg","given":"Rainer"},{"family":"Agapov","given":"Ilya"},{"family":"Brefeld","given":"Werner"},{"family":"Brinkmann","given":"Reinhard"},{"family":"Chae","given":"Yong-Chul"},{"family":"Chao","given":"Hung-Chun"},{"family":"Keil","given":"Joachim"},{"family":"Gavaldà","given":"Xavier Nuel"},{"family":"Röhlsberger","given":"Ralf"},{"family":"Schroer","given":"Christian G."},{"family":"Tischer","given":"Markus"},{"family":"Weckert","given":"Edgar"}],"citation-key":"wanzenberg_etal__2019__design_status_ultralow","DOI":"10/gn3z3b","event-place":"Taipei, Taiwan","event-title":"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYNCHROTRON RADIATION INSTRUMENTATION – SRI2018","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"keyword":"#bf2035/affiliation/desy;_used;#befide/accelerator-based-facility/:petra__petra4","language":"en","page":"30002","publisher-place":"Taipei, Taiwan","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Design status of the ultra-low emittance synchrotron facility PETRA IV","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5084565"},
  {"id":"weckert__2015__potential_future_light","abstract":"Structural studies in general, and crystallography in particular, have benefited and still do benefit dramatically from the use of synchrotron radiation. Low-emittance storage rings of the third generation provide focused beams down to the micrometre range that are sufficiently intense for the investigation of weakly scattering crystals down to the size of several micrometres. Even though the coherent fraction of these sources is below 1%, a number of new imaging techniques have been developed to exploit the partially coherent radiation. However, many techniques in nanoscience are limited by this rather small coherent fraction. On the one hand, this restriction limits the ability to study the structure and dynamics of non-crystalline materials by methods that depend on the coherence properties of the beam, like coherent diffractive imaging and X-ray correlation spectroscopy. On the other hand, the flux in an ultra-small diffraction-limited focus is limited as well for the same reason. Meanwhile, new storage rings with more advanced lattice designs are under construction or under consideration, which will have significantly smaller emittances. These sources are targeted towards the diffraction limit in the X-ray regime and will provide roughly one to two orders of magnitude higher spectral brightness and coherence. They will be especially suited to experiments exploiting the coherence properties of the beams and to ultra-small focal spot sizes in the regime of several nanometres. Although the length of individual X-ray pulses at a storage-ring source is of the order of 100 ps, which is sufficiently short to track structural changes of larger groups, faster processes as they occur during vision or photosynthesis, for example, are not accessible in all details under these conditions. Linear accelerator (linac) driven free-electron laser (FEL) sources with extremely short and intense pulses of very high coherence circumvent some of the limitations of present-day storage-ring sources. It has been demonstrated that their individual pulses are short enough to outrun radiation damage for single-pulse exposures. These ultra-short pulses also enable time-resolved studies 1000 times faster than at standard storage-ring sources. Developments are ongoing at various places for a totally new type of X-ray source combining a linac with a storage ring. These energy-recovery linacs promise to provide pulses almost as short as a FEL, with brilliances and multi-user capabilities comparable with a diffraction-limited storage ring. Altogether, these new X-ray source developments will provide smaller and more intense X-ray beams with a considerably higher coherent fraction, enabling a broad spectrum of new techniques for studying the structure of crystalline and non-crystalline states of matter at atomic length scales. In addition, the short X-ray pulses of FELs will enable the study of fast atomic dynamics and non-equilibrium states of matter.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Weckert","given":"Edgar"}],"citation-key":"weckert__2015__potential_future_light","container-title":"IUCrJ","container-title-short":"Int Union Crystallogr J","DOI":"10/gpg6kc","ISSN":"2052-2525","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",2,3]]},"keyword":"#bf2035/accelerator/erl;_used;#befide/accelerator-based-facility/photon-source/synchrotron-light-source/4th-generation","language":"en-US","note":"https://web.archive.org/web/20210507022939/https://journals.iucr.org/m/issues/2015/02/00/it5005/index.html","page":"230-245","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The potential of future light sources to explore the structure and function of matter","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?S2052252514024269","volume":"2"},
