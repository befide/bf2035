    Collective nuclei are characterized by rotational and vibrational states due
    to a common and therefore “collective” behavior of the two constituents of
    the nucleus: protons and neutrons. The evolution of the collectivity
    (spontaneous deformation) is governed by the proton-neutron interaction in
    the valence shell. Nuclear states that are particularly sensitive to the
    proton-neutron interaction in the valence shell are the so called mixed
    symmetry states (MSSs). In this work we trace the evolution of the
    fundamental MSS, i.e the one-quadrupole phonon 2+_1,ms state, in a
    transitional region from vibrational nuclei (134Xe) to gamma-soft nuclei
    reflecting the O(6)-like structure of the IBM-2 (124,126Xe).
    Projectile-Coulomb excitation of Xe isotopes has been performed at Argonne
    National Laboratory (ANL) using the Gammasphere array for the detection of
    gamma-rays. First, our data on more than 50 absolute E2 transition rates
    between off-yrast low-spin states of 124,126Xe enable us to quantitatively
    test O(6) symmetry in these two nuclei. As a result we find that O(6)
    symmetry is more strongly broken in the A=130 mass region than previously
    thought. Then, 19 absolute E2 transition strengths have been obtained in
    128Xe including the first measurement of the critical B(E2) decays from the
    second and third Jpi=0+ states. These data are compared with the theoretical
    predictions of the critical point symmetry E(5) and let us conclude that
    128Xe is not an E(5) nucleus as previously suggested, leaving 130Xe as the
    most likely candidate amongst the xenon isotopes. Finally, the one-phonon
    2+_1,ms states or at least a fragment of it have been identified in
    128,130,132,134Xe. This enables us to trace the evolution of the one-phonon
    2+_1,ms states in the even-even stable xenon isotopic chain from the
    vibrators near N=82 to the gamma-soft nuclei towards mid-shell.
