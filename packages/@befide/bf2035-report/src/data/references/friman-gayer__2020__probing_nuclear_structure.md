    Neutrinoless double-beta (0νββ) decay is a hypothetical second-order process
    of the weak interaction, which, if observed, would reveal neutrinos as the
    first example of so-called Majorana particles which are their own
    antiparticles. Furthermore, since the decay rate for 0νββ decay is directly
    related to the effective mass of the electron neutrino, it would allow for a
    direct determination of the neutrino mass. However, an obstacle for the
    planning of future 0νββ-decay searches and for a quantitative extraction of
    the neutrino mass are currently the poorly constrained nuclear matrix
    elements which mediate the decay process. These matrix elements have the be
    supplied by nuclear theory, which is challenged with the phenomena of
    nuclear shape evolution and shape coexistence that prevail in regions of the
    nuclear chart where most 0νββ-decay candidates are located. A major problem
    is the lack of sensitive experimental data, which are required to fix the
    parameters of effective theories. Based on a previous successful study, the
    nuclear structure of the candidate pairs 82Se/82Kr and 150Nd/150Sm was
    investigated in this work using the method of nuclear resonance
    fluorescence. The observables of interest were the decay channels of a
    low-lying collective nuclear excitation, the scissors mode, which are
    expected to be highly sensitive to the location of the candidate pairs in
    the phase diagram of nuclear shapes. The scissors mode can be studied
    selectively and with a high degree of model indepedence with the chosen
    method. The experiments were performed at the High-Intensity Gamma-Ray
    Source which currently provides the most intense, linearly polarized,
    quasi-monochromatic photon beam at the energies of interest. Using the high
    sensitivity of the polarized beam, magnetic dipole excitations, which are
    the manifestations of the scissors mode in even-even nuclei, were identified
    and their decay behavior was characterized. A known drawback of experiments
    with monoenergetic photon beams, namely the lack of a photon-flux
    calibration, was solved in the present work without any additional
    instrumentation by calibrating the flux on the nonresonant scattering of
    photons on the targets. For this purpose, a detailed Monte-Carlo particle
    simulation application was developed. For all nuclei of interest, decay
    branches on the order of few percent could either be observed, or
    constrained to such small values. Two effective nuclear models, the shell
    model and the interacting boson model, which are also frequently used to
    predict 0νββ decay matrix elements, were used for a preliminary
    interpretation of the data. For the nucleus 82Se, the shell model gave a
    good description of the energies of excited 1+ states and the total observed
    strength. The good agreement allowed for an interpretation of the structure
    of the wave functions of the scissors mode candidates, which advised against
    a simple relation between the measured quantities and the shape coexistence
    in that nucleus. For the higher-mass isotopes, a careful parameter
    adjustment in the framework of the interacting boson model was able to
    reproduce the entire low-energy structure of 150Nd and, with minor
    exceptions also of 150Sm. The new parameter sets in this model were used
    together with our collaborator to update previous predictions of nuclear
    matrix elements for 0νββ decay. Note that the analysis of the data on the
    A=150 nuclei was done by Jörn Kleemann. This work presents only his main
    results.
