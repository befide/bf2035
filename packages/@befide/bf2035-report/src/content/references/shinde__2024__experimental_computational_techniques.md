    This report is compilation of all the assignment given in the course
    :“Experimental and Computational Techniques in Accelerator Physics (755 ) “.
    This course gives a overview of many different topics in Accelerator physics
    which include : Beamline Design, Electromagnetic Cavity Design, Magnets for
    Accelerators, Beam Instrumentation, Artificial Intelligence and Machine
    Learning, and Engineering Principles for SRF Accelerators. This report
    discusses the homework problems in detail which was given during the course.
    The aim of the course was to give an insights in different topics in
    Accelerator physics. In this report I have done my best to answer all the
    homework questions given in the course. I have shown detail analysis of the
    topics which I have understood
