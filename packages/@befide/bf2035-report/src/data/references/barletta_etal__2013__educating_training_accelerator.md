  abstract: >-
    Accelerator science and technology is inherently an integrative discipline
    that combines aspects of physics, computational science, electrical and
    mechanical engineering. As few universities offer full academic programs,
    the education of accelerator physicists and engineers for the future has
    primarily relied on a combination of on-the-job training supplemented with
    intense courses at regional accelerator schools. This paper describes the
    approaches being used to satisfy the educational interests of a growing
    number of interested physicists and engineers.
