    High energy particle colliders have been in the forefront of particle
    physics for more than three decades. At present the near term US, European
    and international strategies of the particle physics community are centered
    on full exploitation of the physics potential of the Large Hadron Collider
    (LHC) through its high-luminosity upgrade (HL-LHC). A number of next
    generation collider facilities have been proposed and are currently under
    consideration for the medium- and far-future of the accelerator-based high
    energy physics. In this paper we offer a uniform approach to evaluation of
    various accelerators based on the feasibility of their energy reach,
    performance reach and cost range. We briefly review such post-LHC options as
    linear e+e- colliders in Japan (ILC) or at CERN (CLIC), muon collider, and
    circular lepton or hadron colliders in China (CepC/SppC) and Europe (FCC).
    We conclude with a look into ultimate energy reach accelerators based on
    plasmas and crystals, and some perspectives for the far future of
    accelerator-based particle physics.
