    Most of this work is dedicated to the nuclear photoresponse of the stable
    even-even chromium isotopes. These nuclei are of great interest, due to
    their unique position at the lower end of the medium heavy nuclei and with
    regards to magic nucleon number. They were investigated with the nuclear
    resonance fluorescence method at the accelerator facilities of the Darmstadt
    super-conducting electron accelerator S-DALINAC and the high-intensity γ-ray
    source HIγS. Numerous excited states were observed, many of those for the
    first time. Spin and parity quantum numbers as well as transition strengths
    were determined for these states. This enables the photoresponse to be
    distinguished between electric and magnetic dipole strength distribution.
    Therefore, it is possible to analyze the behavior of known modes, such as
    the scissors mode, the spin-flip resonance and in particular the pygmy
    dipole resonance, across a shell closure. In order to do so, the
    interpretation of the obtained data is supported by calculations within the
    nuclear shell model and the relativistic mean-field model.
