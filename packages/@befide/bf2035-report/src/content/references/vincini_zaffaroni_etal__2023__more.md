    Simple Summary

    The therapeutic potential of proton therapy (PT) was first recognized in
    1946 by Robert Wilson, and nowadays, over 100 proton centers are in
    operation worldwide, and more than 60 are under construction or planned.
    Bibliometrics allows us to assess the growth and development of the field
    and provides an overview of the most relevant sources, authors, and
    institutions in the chosen field. Additionally, keyword analysis can be
    performed to provide details that could aid in identifying research trends
    and hot topics. Indeed, bibliometrics allows for identifying the basic and
    dominant themes and trends, as well as those emerging or declining. The aim
    of this study is to provide a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of the
    current status and trends in scientific literature in the PT field. The
    analysis will give an overview of past scientific production and, most
    importantly, provide a useful point of view on the future directions of the
    research activities.


    Abstract

    Background: The therapeutic potential of proton therapy (PT) was first
    recognized in 1946 by Robert Wilson, and nowadays, over 100 proton centers
    are in operation worldwide, and more than 60 are under construction or
    planned. Bibliometric data can be used to perform a structured analysis of
    large amounts of scientific data to provide new insights, e.g., to assess
    the growth and development of the field and to identify research trends and
    hot topics. The aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive bibliometric
    analysis of the current status and trends in scientific literature in the PT
    field. Methods: The literature on PT until the 31st December 2022 in the
    Scopus database was searched, including the following keywords: proton AND
    radiotherapy AND cancer/tumor in title, abstract, and/or keywords. The
    open-source R Studio’s Bibliometrix package and Biblioshiny software
    (version 2.0) were used to perform the analysis. Results: A total of 7335
    documents, mainly articles (n = 4794, 65%) and reviews (n = 1527, 21%), were
    collected from 1946 to 2022 from 1054 sources and 21,696 authors. Of these,
    roughly 84% (n = 6167) were produced in the last 15 years (2008–2022), in
    which the mean annual growth rate was 13%. Considering the corresponding
    author’s country, 79 countries contributed to the literature; the USA was
    the top contributor, with 2765 (38%) documents, of whom 84% were
    single-country publications (SCP), followed by Germany and Japan, with 535
    and 531 documents of whom 66% and 93% were SCP. Considering the themes
    subanalysis (2002–2022), a total of 7192 documents were analyzed; among all
    keywords used by authors, the top three were radiotherapy (n = 1394, 21% of
    documents), intensity-modulated radiotherapy (n = 301, 5%), and prostate
    cancer (n = 301, 5%). Among disease types, prostate cancer is followed by
    chordoma, head and neck, and breast cancer. The change in trend themes
    demonstrated the fast evolution of hotspots in PT; among the most recent
    trends, the appearance of flash, radiomics, relative biological
    effectiveness (RBE), and linear energy transfer (LET) deserve to be
    highlighted. Conclusions: The results of the present bibliometric analysis
    showed that PT is an active and rapidly increasing field of research. Themes
    of the published works encompass the main aspects of its application in
    clinical practice, such as the comparison with the actual photon-based
    standard of care technique and the continuing technological advances. This
    analysis gives an overview of past scientific production and, most
    importantly, provides a useful point of view on the future directions of the
    research activities.
