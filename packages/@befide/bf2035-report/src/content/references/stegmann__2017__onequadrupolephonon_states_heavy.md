  abstract: >-
    One-quadrupole-phonon states of vibrational nuclei have been observed
    throughout the nuclear chart. Collective quadrupole excitations of symmetric
    and mixed-symmetric character allow for investigating the underlying
    microscopic nuclear structure as well as the effective proton-neutron
    interaction. Isovector valence-shell excitations are distinct especially
    near shell closures. The N = 80 isotones around the doubly-magic nucleus
    Sn-132 and the region around the doubly-magic nucleus Pb-208 are of
    particular interest. Projectile Coulomb-excitation experiments on the
    radioactive nucleus Sm-142 and the stable nuclei Hg-202 and Hg-204 were
    performed in order to further our understanding of nuclear structure in
    these regions. The decay strength of the first excited state of Sm-142 is
    determined to B(E2;2_1^+ -¿ 0_1^+) = 32 (4) W.u. It is a foundation for the
    investigation of a possible restoration of shell stabilization in N = 80
    isotones above the Z = 58 subshell closure. The 2_1,ms^+ state of Po-212 has
    recently been identified. The nucleus Hg-204 is the particle-hole conjugate
    to Po-212 with respect to the doubly-magic nucleus Pb-208. Hg-204 was
    investigated together with its neighboring even-even isotope Hg-202 for
    comparison to the situation in Po-212. One quadrupole-phonon mixed-symmetry
    states are identified in both nuclei, with transition strengths of
    B(M1;2_7^+ -¿ 2_1^+) = 0.16 (7) ?_N^2 in Hg-202 and B(M1;2_2^+ -¿ 2_1^+) =
    0.20 (2)?_N^2 in Hg-204. This is the first time, that isovector
    valence-shell excitations have been identified in this mass region, using
    complete sets of decay strengths.
