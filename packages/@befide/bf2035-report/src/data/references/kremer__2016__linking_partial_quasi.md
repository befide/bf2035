    The first part of this thesis revolves around symmetries in the sd-IBA-1. A
    region of approximate O(6) symmetry for the ground-state band, a partial
    dynamical symmetry (PDS) of type III, in the parameter space of the extended
    consistent-Q formalism is identified through quantum number fluctuations.
    The simultaneous occurrence of a SU(3) quasi dynamical symmetry for nuclei
    in the region of O(6) PDS is explained via the beta=1, gamma=0 intrinsic
    state underlying the ground-state band. The previously unrelated concepts of
    PDS and QDS are connected for the first time and many nuclei in the rare
    earth region that approximately satisfy both symmetry requirements are
    identified. Ground-state to ground-state (p,t) transfer reactions are
    presented as an experimental signature to identify pairs of nuclei that both
    exhibit O(6) PDS. In the second part of this thesis inelastic electron
    scattering off 96-Zr is studied. The experiment was performed at the high
    resolution Lintott spectrometer at the S-DALINAC and covered a
    momentum-transfer range of 0.28 - 0.59 fm^(-1). Through a relative analysis
    using Plane Wave Born Approximation (PWBA) the B(E2;2+2-¿0+1) value is
    extracted without incurring the additional model dependence of a Distorted
    Wave Born Approximation (DWBA). By combining this result with known
    multipole mixing ratios and branching ratios all decay strengths of the 2+2
    state are determined. A mixing calculation establishes very weak mixing (V =
    76 keV) between states of the ground-state band and those of the band build
    on top of the 0+2 state which includes the 2+2 state. The occurrence of
    these two isolated bands is interpreted within the shell model in terms of
    type II shell evolution.
