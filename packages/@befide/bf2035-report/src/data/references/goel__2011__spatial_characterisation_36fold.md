    The core principle of segmented gamma-tracking germanium detector arrays
    like AGATA and GRETA, that will be used in future for 4pi gamma detection,
    is the application of pulse shape analysis (PSA). The 3D position
    sensitivity of the HPGe detectors is based on differences in the shape of
    the charge pulses associated with different interaction points inside the
    whole volume. It is therefore necessary for this analysis to have a data
    base containing pulses for all the interaction points inside the detector
    volume. A full 3D scanning of the detectors, which experimentally determines
    pulse shapes for each position inside the active volume, is therefore
    needed. In this thesis, a novel scanning system is presented to determine
    the HPGe detector pulse shapes as a function of the gamma-ray interaction
    position inside the detector. The device is based on a pulse shape
    comparison scan (PSCS) and the positron annihilation correlation (PAC)
    method which makes it about 100 times faster than the conventional
    coincidence based scanners. The performance and efficiency of the system is
    superior because of using a position sensitive detector (PSD)/gamma camera.
    It consists of a LYSO scintillating crystal optically coupled to a position
    sensitive photomultiplier tube. The individual multianode readout (IMAR)
    approach is used to achieve a spatial resolution of <code>126</code> 1 mm
    and to optimize its field of view to <code>126</code> 28 cm^2. A Compton
    scattering imaging technique is implemented to perform an accurate position
    calibration of the gamma camera. The employment of PSD yields an added
    advantage of imaging capability which allows to study e.g. the details of
    the inner structure of HPGe detectors and electric field anisotropy effects.
    The position response of a planar HPGe detector is obtained using the
    apparatus and the risetime distribution plots are compared with those
    obtained via a conventional scanning system. However, to validate the
    aforementioned scanning principle, an AGATA symmetric detector is tested.
    The risetime values are measured as a function of the interaction position
    in both the coaxial and quasi-planar region of the detector. Furthermore,
    the Multi Geometry Simulation (MGS) code is used to generate theoretical
    distribution plots for comparison. The transition in charge carrier
    transport behaviour as a function of the depth is studied for the region of
    the complex electric field. Systematic deviations between simulation and
    measurement are observed for the critical front part of the AGATA detector.
    They are interpolated as due to a non-linear impurity concentration profile
    of the germanium crystal, asking for rigorous scanning of all detectors in
    the future.
