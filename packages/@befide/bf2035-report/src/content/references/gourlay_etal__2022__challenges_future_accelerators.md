    For over half a century, high-energy particle accelerators have been a major
    enabling technology for particle and nuclear physics research as well as
    sources of X-rays for photon science research in material science, chemistry
    and biology. Particle accelerators for energy and intensity Frontier
    research in particle and nuclear physics continuously push the accelerator
    community to invent ways to increase the energy and improve the performance
    of accelerators, reduce their cost, and make them more power efficient. The
    accelerator community has demonstrated imagination and creativity in
    developing a plethora of future accelerator ideas and proposals. The
    technical maturity of the proposed facilities ranges from shovel-ready to
    those that are still largely conceptual. At this time, over 100 contributed
    papers have been submitted to the Accelerator Frontier of the US particle
    physics decadal community planning exercise known as Snowmassâ€™2021. These
    papers cover a broad spectrum of topics: beam physics and accelerator
    education, accelerators for neutrinos, colliders for Electroweak/Higgs
    studies and multi-TeV energies, accelerators for Physics Beyond Colliders
    and rare processes, advanced accelerator concepts, and accelerator
    technology for Radio Frequency cavities (RF), magnets, targets and sources.
    This paper provides an overview of the present state of accelerators for
    particle physics and gives a brief description of some of the major
    facilities that have been proposed, their perceived advantages and some of
    the remaining challenges.
