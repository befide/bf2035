    Research and innovation in particle accelerator science and technology is
    key to the progress of strategic scientific fields where Europe holds a
    leadership position. Moreover, accelerators are increasingly being used in
    health care and industry, where the availability of new accelerator
    technologies can improve our life quality and generate economic growth.
    After several decades of European prominence, in the present critical moment
    for the evolution of particle accelerators the increasing pressure from Asia
    and new far-sighted US initiatives are putting at risk the European role in
    this crucial scientific and technological field. After giving an overview of
    its main challenges and of the present instruments to coordinate and support
    particle accelerator research and innovation in Europe, this report presents
    some conclusions from the Working Groups active within the ARIES project on
    how to enhance industry involvement, showing as a successful example the
    preparation of the new I.FAST project.<br> Finally, the report presents some
    guidelines and a roadmap identified within ARIES towards creating a
    sustainable ecosystem for particle accelerator research and innovation in
    Europe, capable of preserving the European leading position in
    accelerator-based scientific fields and its related advantages for
    high-technology European industry and for the whole European society.
