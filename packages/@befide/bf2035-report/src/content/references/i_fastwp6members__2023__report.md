    The WP6 of IFAST brings together institutes and scientists developing novel
    accelerator concepts and technologies. This concerns in particular modern
    plasma accelerators, lasers, beam drivers and dielectric accelerators. WP6
    organized a special in-person workshop in September 2022 in Elba in Italy,
    just after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. This workshop discussed the
    novel accelerator landscape in Europe and beyond, the subject of this
    milestone report. The session organizers, leaders in their fields, have
    contributed the various chapters to this report.
