    Accelerator facilities require access to many beam parameters during
    operation. The field of beam instrumentation serves this crucial role in
    commissioning, setup and optimisation of the facility. An important
    information is contained in the phase-space distribution of the accelerated
    particles. In case of GSI (Helmholtzzentrum für Schwerionenforschung) those
    are ions from protons to uranium. If established methods to access certain
    beam parameters do not exist, new approaches have to emerge. This is the
    case for the presented measurement setup which has been designed and
    realised by Forck et al. to support commissioning of the GSI high-current
    injector. It is aiming at an experimental method to access the longitudinal
    phase-space distribution at low energies of 1.4 AMeV. Established methods
    for higher energies and based on the measurement of the electric field
    distribution are not feasible at non-relativistic velocities. The presented
    method is based on a time-of-flight (TOF) measurement between two particle
    detectors. A modification allows, alternatively, the direct measurement of
    the kinetic energy using a mono-crystalline (MC) diamond detector.
    Currently, besides others, the focus of the optimisation of the injector is
    put on the longitudinal phase-space distribution. It allows for a systematic
    optimisation of the matching into the accelerator cavities and, thus, an
    improved transmission as well as lower emittance values. The new accelerator
    facility FAIR (Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research), a large-scale
    upgrade at GSI, requires an improved beam quality at the existing injector.
    In this work the experimental setup is investigated for its feasibility to
    measure the longitudinal phase-space distribution. To this end, the phase
    and momentum of the single ions along the beam axis have to be determined
    with high precision. Finally, the longitudinal phase-space distribution is
    identified with the measured ensemble. The setup is presented in detail,
    introducing necessary concepts such as the phase space and emittance and is
    followed by a discussion of the data acquisition and data analysis. An
    important part of the latter is the introduction of a robust estimator for
    the covariance matrix of the measured distribution which is directly
    connected to the RMS emittance. However, the classical estimator is very
    sensitive to outliers in the measured data. The usual approach of subjective
    selection of cut regions is thereby avoided. The TOF setup has been tested
    with low and high current beams where a general sensitivity to the
    longitudinal phase-space distribution was confirmed. Furthermore, the gas
    pressure at the stripper section and the setup of the high-current slits,
    required for beam attenuation, have an impact on the measured distributions.
    Scattering of ions at the slits leads to a larger energy spread, larger
    bunch length and, consequently, emittance. Independent of the configuration,
    deviations from the expected values of the energy spread ∆E/⟨E⟩ ≈ 1 % and
    the Twiss parameter α ≈ 4 have been measured. The energy spreads were larger
    than the theory values by a factor of 1.5-1.6. However, a direct measurement
    of the bunch structure, while using sensible high-current slit settings,
    proved valuable. Low-current measurements with the MC diamond detector
    featured a gain loss of 5 % pulse height and 2 % pulse integral after
    irradiation with ≈ 3×10^4 argon ions. Although this effect is corrected in
    the data analysis, the energy spread is significantly larger than expected,
    like in the TOF measurements. Similarly, the values for α were below 0.5.
    Prominent trails in the measured distribution showed a broad energy spectrum
    and could be quantitatively attributed to interaction with the collimator
    apertures. As the measurements hint an insufficient energy resolution, this
    effect has been investigated in a Gaussian model space. The discrepancies
    between expected and measured values ∆E/⟨E⟩, α and emittance could be
    resolved by assuming a system response of 1.3 %. In the scope of this model
    space and knowledge of the TOF resolution an approximation to the real
    longitudinal phase-space parameter by back transformation of the covariance
    matrix was suggested. Furthermore, the Gaussian model space allowed to
    deduce an analytic formula for the required energy resolution. This showed a
    high dependency of the resolution on the Twiss parameter α which scales with
    1/α. For instance, to target a precision of the emittance within 10 %
    requires a TOF resolution of better than 30 ps. This motivated a survey on
    the possible systematic contributions. The dominating contribution was found
    to be the inhomogeneity of the foils. The tantalum foil alone contributes an
    energy broadening of σE/⟨E⟩ ≈ 1 % and is of the same size of the expected
    energy spread of beam. Including all systematic sources quantitatively
    supports the considerations made in the Gaussian model space. While the
    experimental setup is not yet able to measure the full longitudinal
    phase-space distribution, it is capable of providing valuable information
    about the bunch structure. Several campaigns have been successfully
    supported with bunch-structure measurements.
