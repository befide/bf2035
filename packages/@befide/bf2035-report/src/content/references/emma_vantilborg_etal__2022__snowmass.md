    While the long-term vision of the advanced accelerator community is aimed at
    addressing the challenges of future collider technology, it is critical that
    the community takes advantage of the opportunity to make large societal
    impact through its near-term applications. In turn, enabling robust
    applications strengthens the quality, control, and reliability of the
    underlying accelerator infrastructure. The white paper contributions that
    are solicited here will summarize the near-term applications ideas presented
    by the advanced accelerator community, assessing their potential impact,
    discussing scientific and technical readiness of concepts, and providing a
    timeline for implementation.
