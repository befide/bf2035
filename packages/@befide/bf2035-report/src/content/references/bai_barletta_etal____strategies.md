  abstract: >-
    We summarize the community-based consensus for improvements concerning
    education, public outreach, and inclusion in Accelerator Science and
    Engineering that will enhance the workforce in the USA. The improvements
    identified reflect the product of discussions held within the 2021-2022
    Snowmass community planning process by topical group AF1: Beam Physics and
    Accelerator Education within the Accelerator Frontier. Although the Snowmass
    process centers on high-energy physics, this document outlines required
    improvements for the entire U.S. accelerator science and engineering
    enterprise because education of those entering and in the field, outreach to
    the public, and inclusion are inextricably linked.
