    The CDR is a technical document. The baseline specification is for a 5 MW
    power, long pulse facility delivering neutrons to 22 independent instruments
    for the study of materials in all their diversity from pharmaceuticals and
    membranes, to colloids and polymers, to magnetic and superconducting
    materials, and on to engineering and archeological artefacts. The user
    community is rich and equally diverse, containing approximately 6000
    individuals according to figures produced by ENSA, the European Neutron
    Scattering Association.


    This Conceptual Design Report represents the work of about 250 individual
    scientists and engineers around Europe and the rest of the world, with about
    100 of them located in the central team in Lund in southern Scandinavia
    where the facility is to be built, with Sweden and Denmark as co-hosts.
