  abstract: >-
    Digital Twins (DT) facilitate monitoring and reasoning processes in
    cyber-physical systems. They have progressively gained popularity over the
    past years because of intense research activity and industrial advancements.
    Cognitive Twins is a novel concept, recently coined to refer to the
    involvement of Semantic Web technology in DTs. Recent studies address the
    relevance of ontologies and knowledge graphs in the context of DTs, in terms
    of knowledge representation, interoperability and automatic reasoning.
    However, there is no comprehensive analysis of how semantic technologies,
    and specifically ontologies, are utilized within DTs. This Systematic
    Literature Review (SLR) is based on the analysis of 82 research articles,
    that either propose or benefit from ontologies with respect to DT. The paper
    uses different analysis perspectives, including a structural analysis based
    on a reference DT architecture, and an application-specific analysis to
    specifically address the different domains, such as Manufacturing and
    Infrastructure. The review also identifies open issues and possible research
    directions on the usage of ontologies and knowledge graphs in DTs.
