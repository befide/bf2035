    The mean lifetime of an excited nuclear state is an important observable
    directly related to the transition probability. Information on the mean
    lifetimes of nuclear excited states can give insight into the evolution of
    the nuclear shape as a function of nucleon number. For this work, mean
    lifetimes of the rare-earth isotopes 174,176,178,180Hf and 152Gd have been
    measured. The mean lifetimes have been determined with the fast-timing
    technique, already introduced in the 1950s, but applicable to a wider range
    of excited nuclear states, due to rapid progress in the development of new
    scintillation detectors in the last two decades. Both experiments have been
    performed at the FN Tandem accelerator of the IFIN-HH with the ROSPHERE
    detector array. A possible new signature for the known quantum phase
    transition at N=90 has been established with the results from the 152Gd
    experiment and the correlation to other observables, such as the E0
    transition strength, has been investigated. The evolution of collectivity
    and the rotational structure of the hafnium isotopes have been investigated
    and a maximum of the collectivity at N=100 has been identified. In total 13
    mean lifetimes have been determined for the 174,176,178,180Hf isotopes. The
    nuclear magnetic dipole moment is an important indicator of the composition
    of the proton neutron wave function, and therefore the single particle
    properties of the nuclear state. The second part of this thesis presents the
    results from a g-factor measurement of the 2+1 state of 18O with the
    recently developed ECR-TDRIV technique. The method is in particular foreseen
    for the application to radioactive ion beams, but has to be tested with
    stable beams. The analysis procedure of the 18O experiment is outlined and
    the results for the g factor are compared to previous measurements and shell
    model calculations.
