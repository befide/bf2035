    The investigation and identification of mixed-symmetry states stand in the
    focus of this work. They are formed from collective vibrations and rotations
    of valence neutrons and protons, where the two nucleon groups oscillate
    partly out-of-phase with respect to each other. In vibrational nuclei, the
    $2^+_\mathrm{1,ms}$ state is the lowest-lying mixed-symmetry level. For the
    $N=80$ isotones, the sub-shell closure at $Z=58$ highly effects the
    structure of the $2^+_\mathrm{1,ms}$ state. Up to $Z=56$, the isotones have
    isolated $2^+_\mathrm{1,ms}$ states, but for $^{138}$Ce ($Z=58$), it is
    strongly fragmented. This behaviour is explained by the valence-shell
    stabilization, which is lacking at the proton sub-shell closure $Z=58$. For
    addressing the question how the $2^+_\mathrm{1,ms}$ state behaves while
    going beyond the proton sub-shell closure, projectile Coulomb-excitation
    experiments were performed. They took place at HIE-ISOLDE at CERN using the
    $\gamma$-ray spectrometer Miniball with the radioactive ion beams of the
    $N=80$ isotones $^{140}$Nd and $^{142}$Sm. The enhanced
    $B(M1;2^+_3\to2^+_1)=0.26^{+0.11}_{-0.10}\,\mu_\mathrm{N}^2$ strength and
    the low upper limit $B(M1;2^+_4\to2^+_1)¡0.04\,\mu_\mathrm{N}^2$ of
    $^{140}$Nd showed the restoration of the valence-shell stabilization at
    $Z=60$. From the $M1$ strength distribution, the quality of the $F$ spin of
    $^{140}$Nd was determined by the $F$-spin mixing matrix element
    $V_\mathrm{F-mix}¡7^{+13}_{-7}\,\mathrm{keV}$. The reduced mixing matrix
    element supports the proposed restoration of the valence-shell
    stabilization. For $^{142}$Sm, the Coulomb-excitation analysis delivered an
    upper limit $B(M1;2^+_3\to2^+_1)¡0.14^{+0.37}_{-0.01}\,\mu_\mathrm{N}^2$,
    which is not in conflict with the conclusions from the $^{140}$Nd
    experiment. A complementary $\gamma$-$\gamma$ correlation measurement after
    $\beta^+$/$\epsilon$ decay to determine the indispensable $E2$/$M1$
    multipole-mixing ratio $\delta$ of the $2^+_3\to2^+_1$ transition of
    $^{142}$Sm was designed for the Heavy Ion Laboratory in Warsaw and accepted.
    For the stable $^{202}$Hg, a projectile Coulomb-excitation experiment was
    conducted at the ATLAS facility at the ANL using the $\gamma$-ray
    spectrometer Gammasphere. Simultaneously, angular particle-$\gamma$
    correlations were measured with the aim of deducing $\delta$. In $^{202}$Hg
    a pronounced $B(M1;2^+_7\to2^+_1)=0.18(8) \,\mu_\mathrm{N}^2$ with
    $\delta=0.06(4)$ was found, while an upper limit for the neighboring
    transition was obtained, $B(M1;2^+_8\to2^+_1)¡0.027 \,\mu_\mathrm{N}^2$. For
    the first time in the mass region $A\approx200$, the $F$-spin mixing quality
    was determined, for $^{202}$Hg and $^{204}$Hg,
    $V_\mathrm{F-mix}=9(2)^{+3}_{-3}\,\mathrm{keV}$ and
    $11(1)^{+4}_{-5}\,\mathrm{keV}$, respectively. Consequently, $F$ spin can be
    considered a sufficiently good approximate quantum number in the
    investigated nuclei of $N,Z=80$ near doubly-magic isotopes.
