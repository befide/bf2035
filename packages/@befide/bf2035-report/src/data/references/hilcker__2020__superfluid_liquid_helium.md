    The aim of this work was to develop a superfluid helium target for electron
    scattering experiments at the S-DALINAC. The target consists of a multistage
    helium cryostat including target cell and corresponding scattering chamber.
    It is initially filled with liquid helium at boiling temperature and then
    cooled down to 1.8 K via vapor pressure reduction. The infrastructure of the
    QCLAM spectrometer provides a set of basic conditions for the design.
    Difficulties in handling liquid helium provide further challenges. After the
    delivery of the required components, the cryostat had to be assembled and
    tested. The development of a suitable cooling procedure was a particularly
    critical point. The functionality of the cryostat was demonstrated in a
    following experiment. The assumed advantages of superfluid helium instead of
    liquid helium at boiling temperature as target material were confirmed. A
    commissioning experiment at the QCLAM spectrometer was performed. By
    evaluating the spectrum of elastically scattered electrons, the target
    thickness could be measured experimentally. It agrees with the geometric
    manufacturer's specifications. During the experiment, the focusing of the
    electron beam on the target was difficult. Therefore, simulations on a
    modified target cell geometry with an increased target area were performed.
