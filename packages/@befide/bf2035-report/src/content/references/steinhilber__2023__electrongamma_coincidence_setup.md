    This work describes the development, construction and commissioning of a new
    setup for (e,e'γ)-coincidence measurements at the superconducting Darmstadt
    linear accelerator S-DALINAC. (e,e'γ) reactions are characterized by the
    pure electromagnetic interaction in the excitation and in the decay channels
    and thereby allow nuclear physics investigations with high precision. In
    contrast to inclusive electron scattering, this measurement method is
    directly sensitive to the interference of longitudinal and transverse form
    factors, which affects the angular distribution of the emitted photons. To
    establish the new (e,e?γ) setup, the existing large acceptance QCLAM
    electron spectrometer was combined with a new setup consisting of LaBr_3:Ce
    detectors. For the readout of the γ-ray detectors, a new data acquisition
    system was developed and combined with the existing QCLAM data acquisition
    system to form a coincidence data acquisition. A software package for data
    analysis was developed. In the first commissioning experiment on the 2_1^+
    and 1_2^+ states of 12C, the functionality of the (e,e'γ)-setup could be
    demonstrated. Findings from this and from a second commissioning experiment
    on 96Ru, together with GEANT4 simulations, were used to optimize the setup
    with a particular focus on the reduction of background radiation in the
    γ-ray detectors. The full and optimized setup was used in a first production
    run on a 96Ru target to measure the γ-decay behavior below and above the
    neutron separation threshold. Isolated states were observed to decay via the
    2_1^+ state of 96Ru. Above the neutron separation threshold, 96Ru decays by
    emission of a neutron to 95Ru. Depopulations of the low-lying states of 95Ru
    were observed.
