## Why excellence?

### Horizon Europe

Horizon Europe (2021 to 2027) is the European Union's current framework programme for research and innovation. With 95 billion euros, it is the world's largest single funding programme for research and innovation.

The framework programme is divided into three major focus areas: Scientific Excellence, Global Challenges and European Industrial Competitiveness and Innovative Europe

The "Scientific excellence" part strives to support the best minds in Europe at all stages of their scientific careers.
