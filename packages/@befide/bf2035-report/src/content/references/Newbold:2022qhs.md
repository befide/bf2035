    The 2020 update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics Update (ESPPU)
    outlined the current status and prospects in the field, and identified
    priorities for future particle physics accelerator facilities. In time
    order, these are: completion and commissioning of the CERN High Luminosity
    LHC (HL-LHC); a future electron-positron Higgs factory; and a future hadron
    collider at the highest achievable energy and luminosity.

    It is recognised in the community, and was acknowledged in the ESPPU, that
    construction of the next generations of colliders will be extremely
    challenging. In most cases, there are major technical obstacles to meeting
    the exceptional performance requirements. As documented throughout this
    report, achieving our long-term scientific goals will require the
    exploration and maturation of new technologies, materials and techniques to
    well beyond the current state of the art. Since many of these technologies
    are unique to particle physics in their immediate application, then this can
    only result from a new and extended phase of R&amp;D organised within our
    own institutes and in conjunction with industry and related scientific
    fields. This is similar to the precursor R&amp;D that led to the successful
    delivery of previous generations of machines, but is likely to be longer in
    duration and wider in scope.
