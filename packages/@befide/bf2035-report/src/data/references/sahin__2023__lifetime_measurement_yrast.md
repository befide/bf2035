    Over the past decades, studies of nuclear structure have led to numerous
    experiments aimed at understanding the properties of the nucleus. One of the
    main challenges of this field is the investigation of exotic nuclei, which
    are characterized by a large excess of neutrons or protons, and are located
    far from the stability line. To carry out this investigation, experimental
    techniques capable of producing and detecting these exotic nuclei are
    required. At the GSI Helmholtzzentrum für Schwerionenforschung in Germany,
    the DESPEC setup has been utilized to conduct important nuclear structure
    studies on exotic nuclei. This setup, in combination with the high-intensity
    primary beams available at GSI, has provided significant opportunities for
    the investigation of these exotic nuclei. In March 2021, an experiment was
    conducted at GSI where isotopes of interest were generated through the
    fragmentation of a primary ?⁰⁸Pb beam with an energy of 1 GeV/u directed at
    a ⁹Be target. The final products were then identified on an event-by-event
    basis in the FRS based on their proton number (Z) and mass-to-charge ratio
    (A/Q), and they were implanted in the DESPEC setup. To further investigate
    the nuclear structure of these exotic nuclei, measuring the lifetime of
    excited nuclear states was performed. The measurement was carried out using
    36 ultra-fast LaBr₃(Ce) detectors from the FATIMA setup. This setup, through
    a fast-timing technique, enables the hard-to-reach short-lifetime values of
    those excited states. This work presents a new isomeric lifetime measurement
    for ?⁹⁰W. Additionally, we obtained the lifetime of the first 2⁺ state of
    ?⁹⁰W for the first time using the generalized centroid difference method. In
    view of the systematic behavior of the R₄₂ , B₂₂ , and B(E2) values, the
    known spectroscopic data on ?⁹⁰W matches the predictions for γ-softness.
    These experimental results have been compared to new theoretical
    calculations obtained within the interacting boson model (IBM-2). Both
    experimental and theoretical results agree that the known spectroscopic data
    on ?⁹⁰W matches the predictions for the most γ-soft, O(6)-like isotope in
    the tungsten isotopic chain, approaching the N=126 shell closure. Overall,
    our study provides new insights into the nuclear structure of exotic nuclei
    and highlights the importance of advanced experimental techniques in this
    field.
