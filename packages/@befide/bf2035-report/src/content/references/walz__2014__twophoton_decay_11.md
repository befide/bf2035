    The first part of this thesis covers the two-photon decay of the 11/2-
    isomer in 137Ba. Clear evidence of this exotic decay mode is found, which
    opens up the possibility to use the two-photon decay probability as a
    general tool to investigate the structure of atomic nuclei. Details on the
    experiment are given, and the major challenges to successfully perform this
    difficult experiment are outlined. The two-photon decay experiment was
    conducted with the new LaBr3-detector ball which was setup from scratch in
    the framework of this thesis. The properties and performance of this
    powerful detector system - consisting of 18 large LaBr3-detectors - are
    discussed. Furthermore, proton scattering at 200 MeV has been performed on
    the nuclei 92,94Zr, 94,96Mo and 70Zn.The measured cross sections are
    compared to calculations in the framework of the Quasi-Particle Phonon Model
    (QPM). Conclusions about the validity of the QPM results are drawn. A
    comparison of the excitation cross sections of the 2+1 states and the
    one-phonon quadrupole states with mixed neutron and proton symmetry (2+ms)
    allows to prove the special character of the 2+ms states independently of
    electromagnetic transition strengths. The possible existence of 3- and 4+
    states with mixed proton and neutron symmetry is discussed. Furthermore the
    origin of collectivity of low-lying states in spherical nuclei is
    investigated in the QPM.
