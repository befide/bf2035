    Abstract
                The High-Brilliance Neutron Source (HBS) project aims to design a scalable compact accelerator driven neutron source (CANS) which is competitive and cost-efficient. The concept allows one to optimize the whole facility including accelerator, target, moderators and neutron optics to the demands of individual neutron instruments. Particle type, energy, timing, and pulse structure of the accelerator are fully defined by the requirements of a given neutron instrument. In the following, we present the current status of the HBS project.

    TLDR: The High-Brilliance Neutron Source project aims to design a scalable
    compact accelerator driven neutron source (CANS) which is competitive and
    cost-efficient and allows one to optimize the whole facility including
    accelerator, target, moderators and neutron optics to the demands of
    individual neutron instruments.
