    The German Excellence Initiative started in 2006 as a public funding program
    of crucial importance for German universities. Since this time, several
    studies on different aspects of the program have been conducted, but there
    have been no analyses using bibliometric methods to measure the direct
    effects of funding—which is apparently due to the fact that publications
    resulting from the funding program are not publicly and comprehensively
    documented. This paper uses the concept of highly cited publications to
    measure excellent research, and explores two methodological approaches in
    order to attribute highly cited publications to the Excellence Initiative.
    To this end, the paper focuses on publications produced by the clusters of
    excellence (CoEs). The clusters of excellence constitute only one of three
    funding lines, but receive 60 % of the total funding of the excellence
    program and form the core research units of the Excellence Initiative. The
    highly cited publications of the CoEs are identiﬁed via self-selected lists
    of publications in the CoE renewal proposals and via a funding
    acknowledgement analysis. The validity of both data sources is analyzed
    comparatively. Based on the objectives of the Excellence Initiative, its
    effects on the level of funded clusters, universities and the overall German
    research system are explored. The bibliometric analysis gives evidence that
    the funding program has succeeded in concentrating excellent research and
    fostering collaborations between universities and the non-university
    research sector, but has not caused massive changes to the overall German
    research system.
