    Inelastic proton scattering of 70,72,74Ni and 76,78,80Zn was performed at
    the RIBF facility of the RIKEN Nishina Center, Japan, as part of the first
    SEASTAR campaign. Radioactive isotopes were produced by the in-flight
    fission of a beam of 238U ions incident on a 3 mm thick Beryllium target.
    After production, neutron-rich radioactive isotopes were selected and
    identified on an event-by-event basis using the BigRIPS separator. Selected
    isotopes of interest were focused onto the liquid hydrogen target of the
    MINOS device and gamma-rays from inelastic (p, p') reactions were detected
    with the DALI2 array, consisting of 186 NaI crystals. Outgoing beam-like
    particles were identified using the ZeroDegree spectrometer. Gamma-rays
    produced in the reaction were Doppler corrected and the first 2+ and 4+
    states in all the isotopes were identified. Detailed data analysis was
    performed including the implementation of algorithms that discriminate
    events where more than one particle was present. Using detailed Geant4
    simulations, exclusive cross-sections for inelastic proton scattering were
    obtained. Deformation lengths were deduced from the experimental
    cross-sections using the coupled-channel calculation code ECIS-97. The
    deformations lengths of 72,74Ni and 76,80Zn were found to be fairly constant
    at a value of 0.8(2) fm, suggesting similar vibrational amplitudes, while
    the isomeric presence in the secondary beams of 70Ni and 78Zn allowed only
    lower limits for those two isotopes. By combining the deformation lengths
    with the known B(E2; 0+ -¿ 2+) values, the neutron-to-proton matrix element
    ratios, Mn/Mp, were obtained. A clear indication of the closed proton shell
    in the 72,74Ni could be observed, as Mn/Mp ¿ N/Z, indicating an increased
    contribution of the neutrons to the vibrational amplitude. For the case of
    76,80Zn, Mn/Mp ¡ N/Z, indicating an open proton shell.
