  abstract: >-
    Higher-order modes (HOMs) may affect beam stability and refrigeration
    requirements of superconducting proton linacs such as the SPL which is being
    studied at CERN. One option being considered to limit these effects is the
    use of coaxial HOM couplers. In this work, potentially dangerous modes are
    analyzed and corresponding damping requirements derived. The design process
    of coaxial HOM couplers is examined under new aspects. Several prototypes
    are elaborated and compared in terms of mode damping, thermal loads,
    structural deformations, mechanical tolerances, and multipacting.
