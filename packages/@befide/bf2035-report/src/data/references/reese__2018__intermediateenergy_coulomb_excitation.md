    This thesis is about the improvement of software tools and methods for
    analyzing high resolution γ-ray spectroscopy data of intermediate energy
    Coulomb excitation experiments at the PreSPEC-AGATA setup. In the past,
    pioneering experiments have been done in the RISING campaign at GSI. The
    PreSPEC-AGATA setup has been the next step in the evolution of this type of
    experiments, with better and more complex instrumentation, leading to higher
    sensitivity and resolution. This work is relevant for for the preparation of
    the even more demanding future HISPEC setup at the upcoming FAIR facility.
    HISPEC experiments will study low-lying excited states of nuclei far from
    stability, in order to test the validity of nuclear structure models in that
    area of the nuclear chart. More complex instrumentation results in more
    complex data analysis programs. In order to deal with the complexity
    involved in developing such software for the upcoming experiments, a more
    systematic approach to the development process is needed. Within this work,
    a software framework was developed to facilitate a systematic and clean
    software design. This might be helpful for upcoming NUSTAR experiments at
    FAIR, where a large number of independent detector systems have to be
    integrated into a big setup. The design of the framework is discussed in the
    second chapter of this thesis. One important reaction mechanism for the
    HISPEC experiments is Coulomb excitation at energies of around 150 MeV/u.
    Because of the purely electromagnetic nature of the interaction, Coulomb
    excitation is described well by theoretical models. In the third chapter of
    this thesis, a numerical simulation program for relativistic ion-ion
    collisions was developed that solves the coupled channel equations for
    electric Coulomb excitation. In the fourth chapter, the relevant detector
    systems of the PreSPEC setup are presented, and the calibration of them is
    discussed. A main aspect of the work was the development of improved ways to
    analyze data from these devices, and, if possible to provide semi-automatic
    implementations for their calibration. In the last chapter, the total
    efficiency of the PreSPEC-setup was determined for a typical Coulomb
    excitation experiment, and the possibility to measure projectile excitation
    cross-sections relative to a target excitation cross-section is
    demonstrated.
