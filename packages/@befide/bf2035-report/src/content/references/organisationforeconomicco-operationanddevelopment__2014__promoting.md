  abstract: >-
    National research systems face an increasingly competitive environment for
    ideas, talent and funds, and governments have shifted funds from
    institutional core funding to project funding, often on a competitive basis,
    or reward success in raising third-party funds in performance-based funding
    schemes. It is in this context that "research excellence initiatives" (REIs)
    have emerged. This is an instrument designed to encourage outstanding
    research by providing large-scale, long-term funding to designated research
    units. They provide funds for research and research-related measures, such
    as the improvement or extension of physical infrastructure, the recruitment
    of outstanding researchers from abroad and researcher training. This report
    presents new evidence on how governments steer and fund public research in
    higher education and public research institutions through REIs. The report
    can help inform discussions on future government policy directions by
    providing information on how REIs work and on the functioning and
    characteristics of institutions that host centres of excellence. The
    findings show some of the benefits to be gained through REIs and note some
    pitfalls to be avoided
