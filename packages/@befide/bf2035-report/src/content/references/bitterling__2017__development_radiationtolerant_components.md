    This works describes the results of a three year project to improve the
    radiation tolerance of the Quench Protection System of the CERN Large Hadron
    Collider. Radiation-induced premature beam aborts have been a limiting
    factor for accelerator availability in the recent years. Furthermore, the
    future upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider to its High Luminosity phase
    will further increase the radiation load and has higher requirements for the
    overall machine availability. Therefore equipment groups like the Quench
    protection groups have used the last years to redesign many of their systems
    to fulfill those requirements. In support of the development of
    radiation-tolerant systems, several proton beam irradiation campaigns were
    conducted to determine the inherent radiation tolerance of a selection of
    varied electronic components. Using components from this selection a new
    Quench Protection System for the 600 A corrector magnets was developed. The
    radiation tolerance of this system was further improved by developing a
    filter and error correction system for all discovered failure modes.
    Furthermore, compliance of the new system with the specification was shown
    by simulating the behavior of the system using data taken from the
    irradiation campaigns. The resulting system is operational since the
    beginning of 2016 and has in the first 9 months of operation not shown a
    single radiation-induced failure. Using results from simulations and
    irradiation campaigns the predicted failure cross section for the full new
    600 A Quench Protection System is 4.358 ± 0.564 * 10^-10 cm2 which is one
    order of magnitude lower than the target set during the development of this
    system.
