    Atomic nuclei are complex many-body quantum systems. Still, selected
    properties can often be modeled by macroscopic equilibrium shapes. Their
    evolution with nucleon number exhibits all signs of phase-transitional
    behavior. A prominent example for a transition between spherical and
    axially-symmetric deformed phases is the region of the nuclear chart in the
    vicinity of N = 90. It is characterized by a rapid onset of deformation with
    neutron number which is discernible from a multitude of observables such as
    isomer shifts, excitation energies, and transition strengths. Mixed-symmetry
    states ? states with nontrivial symmetry properties regarding their proton
    and neutron subsystems ? have proven their sensitivity to the underlying
    shell structure as well as shape evolution across quantum phase transitions.
    Especially the electromagnetic transitions between the 1+ scissors mode and
    the 0+2 state are strongly affected by the amount of nuclear deformation. In
    this work, the elusive E2 properties of mixed-symmetry states are
    established as novel signatures for phase- transitional behavior. This
    includes their extraction for the transitional nucleus 154Gd and the
    quadrupole deformed nuclei 162,164Dy using the method of nuclear resonance
    fluorescence at the High-Intensity γ-ray Source in Durham, NC, USA in
    connection with calculations in the proton-neutron version of the algebraic
    Interacting Boson Model. Precision values for the branching ratios between
    the scissors mode and the 2+1 state of 164Dy uncover significant deviations
    from the Alaga predictions for K = 1 states. From a two-state mixing
    calculation, the K- mixing matrix element along with first information on ?K
    = 0 M1 excitation strength is obtained. The latter is about two orders of
    magnitude smaller than usual collective ?K = 1 M1 strengths. This mixing is
    caused by the Coriolis interaction. It represents a first-order perturbation
    of a Hamiltonian which is diagonal in K. The associated mixing matrix
    element is twice as large as the one obtained from the second-order effect
    which admixes ground and γ bands.
