    This document provides detailed information on the status of Advanced and
    Novel Accelerators techniques and describes the steps that need to be
    envisaged for their implementation in future accelerators, in particular for
    high energy physics applications. It complements the overview prepared for
    the update of the European Strategy for particle physics, and provides a
    detailed description of the field. The scientific priorities of the
    community are described for each technique of acceleration able to achieve
    accelerating gradient in the GeV~range or above. ALEGRO working group
    leaders have coordinated the preparation of their working group contribution
    and contributed to editing the documents. The preparation of this document
    was coordinated by the Advanced LinEar collider study GROup, ALEGRO. The
    content was defined through discussions at the ALEGRO workshop in Oxford UK,
    March 2018, and an advanced draft was discussed during a one day meeting
    prior to the AAC workshop in Breckenridge, CO, USA, August 2018. This
    document was submitted as an addendum to the ALEGRO submission to the
    European Strategy for Particle Physics.
