    The paper presents a digest of the research results in the domain of
    accelerator science and technology in Europe, shown during the annual
    meeting of the EuCARD – European Coordination of Accelerator Research and
    Development. The conference concerns building of the research
    infrastructure, including in this advanced photonic and electronic systems
    for servicing large high energy physics experiments. There are debated a few
    basic groups of such systems like: measurement – control networks of large
    geometrical extent, multichannel systems for large amounts of metrological
    data acquisition, precision photonic networks of reference time, frequency
    and phase distribution.
