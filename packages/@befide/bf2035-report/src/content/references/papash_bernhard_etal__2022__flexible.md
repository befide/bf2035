  abstract: >-
    Within the cSTART project (compact storage ring for accelerator research and
    technology), a Very Large Acceptance compact Storage Ring (VLA-cSR) will be
    realized at the Institute for Beam Physics and Technology (IBPT) of the
    Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. (KIT). A modified geometry of a compact
    storage ring operating at 50 MeV energy range has been studied and main
    features of the new model are described here. The new design, based on 45°
    bending magnets, is suitable to store a wide momentum spread beam as well as
    ultra-short electron bunches in the sub-ps range injected from the plasma
    cell as well as from the Ferninfrarot Linac- Und Test Experiment (FLUTE).
    The DBA lattice of the VLA-cSR with different settings and relaxed
    parameters, split elements and higher order optics of tolerable strength
    allows to improve the dynamic aperture and momentum acceptance to an
    acceptable level. This contribution discusses the lattice features in
    detail, expected lifetime, injection, tolerances and different possible
    operation schemes of the ring.
