    Mid-shell nuclei in the mass region A<code>126</code>100 show collective
    behavior. For instance, neutron rich even-even molybdenum isotopes are
    associated with a shape-phase transition. A spherical vibrator nucleus is
    observed for N=48 neutrons, while measurements indicate a deformed rotor
    nucleus for N=64 neutrons. In order to characterize the shape of molybdenum
    nuclei better, thus the shape-phase transition in molybdenum isotopes, a
    PreSPEC-AGATA experiment was performed at GSI. In particular, the experiment
    aimed at measuring the lifetime of the 4+ excited state of 108Mo to deduce
    the decay transition rate of the 4+ state. The production of 108Mo was
    performed in two steps. First, the GSI Fragment-Separator (FRS) selected
    109Tc ions produced via fission of a 238U beam. Then, 109Tc ions underwent a
    fragmentation reaction on a beryllium secondary target. Half-speed of light
    fragments produced in this second reaction were identified by the
    Lund-York-Cologne CAlorimeter (LYCCA). gamma-rays were detected by the AGATA
    array positioned around the secondary target at forward angles. A complex
    electronics and data-acquisition system was set up to record the
    coincidences between a flying ion and the gamma-rays it emitted. The
    interaction position of gamma-rays inside an AGATA crystal is determined
    with good resolution. Therefore, combined with the large Doppler shift of
    the gamma-ray, it provides a unique possibility to measure lifetime with the
    Geometrical-Doppler-Shift-Attenuation method. From the data analysis which
    included several new techniques, the half-life of T1/2 = 11 (+16;-6) ps was
    extracted for the first 4+ state of 108Mo. The statistics recorded in this
    experiment is relatively low which leads to a large uncertainty on this
    measurement. With this large uncertainty, it is not possible to conclude on
    the exact behavior of the 108Mo nucleus, even though the comparison of our
    measurement with geometrical models would favor a transitional nucleus with
    approximate X(5) solution of the Bohr-Hamiltonian. However, this measurement
    proves the possibility of lifetime determination coupling relativistic ion
    beams with the AGATA array. Therefore, it represents a crucial step towards
    more precise measurements that will be performed at HISPEC with the
    increased beam intensity provided by the Super-FRS at FAIR.
