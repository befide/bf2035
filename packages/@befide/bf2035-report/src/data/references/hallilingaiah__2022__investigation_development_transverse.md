    The thesis described the development of a beam separator device for the ELBE
    accelerator in Dresden, Germany, facilitating simultaneous operation of
    multiple secondary user stations. After reviewing deflecting structures, an
    RF cavity was chosen as the optimal solution. Extensive electromagnetic and
    multiphysics analysis were conducted to optimize the cavity design. A copper
    deflecting cavity was manufactured and underwent rigorous high-power
    testing, successfully meeting the design requirements. The cavity is now
    ready for installation in the ELBE beamline.
