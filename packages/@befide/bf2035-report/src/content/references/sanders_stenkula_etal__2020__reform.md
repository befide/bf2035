    In this chapter, we outline a reform strategy to promote a more
    entrepreneurial society in Germany. Germany has developed a successful model
    of capitalism in which high productivity growth is driven by on-the-job
    learning and firm-specific skill accumulation. The economy is rooted in a
    strong and regionally embedded Mittelstand, which supports an
    export-oriented industry mainly based on incremental innovations, but which
    is less conducive to more radical innovation. We, therefore, suggest a
    reform agenda for Germany that encourages more entrepreneurial
    experimentation with the aim of facilitating radical innovation, both in
    incumbent and new firms. Germany’s entrepreneurial talent should be
    encouraged to take on more risk, the education system could promote
    initiative, creativity and a willingness to experiment, and a more equal
    playing field between dependent employment and self-employment/employer
    could be created.
