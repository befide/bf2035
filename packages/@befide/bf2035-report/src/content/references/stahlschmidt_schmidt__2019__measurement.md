  abstract: >-
    The bibliometric measurement process transfers scientific publications and
    citations into indicators on scientific impact. In defining specific
    measurement paths researchers hold several degrees of freedom as various
    methodical decisions are scarcely founded on stringent criteria and their
    respective implications are not fully understood. These diverse measurement
    paths result in varying measurements. We propose to compute many possible
    measurement paths and to analyse the resulting measurement variation. On the
    one hand, effects of decisions can thus be better understood and on the
    other hand the resulting measurement variation should be taken into account
    when using impact values for e.g. funding decisions.
