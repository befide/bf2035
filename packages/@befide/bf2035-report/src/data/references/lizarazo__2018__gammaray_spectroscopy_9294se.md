  abstract: >-
    The isomeric decay of 92,94Se has been studied by means of gamma-ray decay
    spectroscopy, in order to explore the nuclear structure of these very
    neutron-rich exotic nuclei far way from the ?stability line?. The experiment
    was conducted in March 2015 at the Radioactive Ion Beam Factory of the RIKEN
    Nishina Center (RIBF-RIKEN) located in Japan. A radioactive beam of exotic
    nuclei was delivered by the BigRIPS fragment separator, tuned to select the
    desired products of the in-flight fission of a 238U primary beam on a Be
    target. This secondary beam impinged on a liquid Hydrogen (LH2) target,
    producing Selenium nuclei via different nucleon knock-out reactions. The
    final products passed through the ZeroDegree mass spectrometer, where they
    were identified on an event-by-event basis by means of determination of the
    proton number (Z) and mass-to-charge ratio (A/Q), and were finally implanted
    into a stack of silicon layers of the AIDA detector system. The existence
    and subsequent decay of isomeric excited states of these nuclei was studied
    with the EURICA gamma-ray HPGe detector placed around the AIDA layers. New
    spectroscopic information has been obtained for both isotopes, leading to an
    extension of their level schemes. In particular, the isomeric state of 94 Se
    has been observed for the first time. The possible causes of isomerism in
    these nuclei have been discussed and compared with the results, and it has
    been found that the presence of oblate-deformed quasi-particle states play
    an important role in the description of the isomerism phenomenon. The level
    schemes obtained have been compared with the predictions of different
    state-of-the-art beyond mean-field calculations, which propose all a
    prolate-to-oblate shape transition with increasing neutron number taking
    place between N=56 and N=60 (90,92,94 Se). Based on the observed structure
    of the level schemes and the deformation character of the isomeric states,
    the idea of a shape transition into an oblate structure at N=60 is
    supported.
