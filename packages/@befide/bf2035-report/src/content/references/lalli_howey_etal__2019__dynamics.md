    This paper presents a novel methodology for defining and analyzing the
    dynamics of the collaboration networks of scientists working on general
    relativity from the mid-1920s-1970. During these four and a half decades the
    status of the theory underwent a radical transformation: from a marginal
    theory before the mid-1950s to a pillar of modern physics. To investigate
    this passage-known as the renaissance of general relativity-we used a
    definition of collaboration networks broader than the co-authorship
    relations retriev-able from online datasets. We constructed a multilayer
    network, in which each layer represents a different kind of collaboration.
    After having analyzed the evolution over time of specific parameters of the
    co-authorship network, we investigated the effects of adding one type of
    collaboration edge at a time, in a cumulative fashion, on the values of
    these parameters and on the topology of the collaboration network through
    time, including rapid shifts in the dynamic evolution of the largest
    component. This analysis provides robust quantitative evidence that a shift
    in the structure of the relativity collaboration network occurred between
    the late 1950s and the early 1960s, when a giant component started forming.
    We interpret this shift as the central social dynamic of the renaissance
    process and then identify its central actors. Our analysis disproves common
    explanations of the renaissance process. It shows that this phenomenon was
    not a consequence of astrophysical discoveries in the 1960s, nor was it a
    simple by-product of socioeconomic transformations in the physics landscape
    after World War II.
