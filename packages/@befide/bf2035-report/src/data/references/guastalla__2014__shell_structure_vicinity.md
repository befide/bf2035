    The PreSPEC setup in combination with the high intensity primary beams
    available at GSI provided unique opportunities for the key nuclear structure
    studies on exotic nuclei. The experiment performed on the neutron deficient
    104Sn aimed to deduce the reduced transition probability of the first
    excited 2+ state quantified by the B(E2; 0+ → 2+) value. This result is the
    central point in the discussion of the evolution of nuclear structure in
    proximity of the doubly magic nucleus 100Sn. As 100Sn is not yet accessible
    for such measurements, a series of experiments have been performed for
    neutron-deficient Sn isotopes over the past few years. These data showed
    excessive ex- perimental B(E2) strength compared to shell model calculations
    below neutron number N=64 and they are therefore not excluding a constant or
    even increasing collectivity below 106Sn. Hence, the measurement of the
    B(E2) value in the next even-even isotope toward 100Sn, i.e. 104Sn, was a
    crucial step to verify the robustness of the shell gap of 100Sn. Moreover,
    104Sn is the heaviest isotope of the Sn isotopic chain for which a shell
    model calculation without significant truncation of the valence space can be
    performed and therefore with this experimental value the validity of Large
    Scale Shell Model (LSSM) calculations could be tested. As a main result of
    the experiment a B(E2) value corresponding to 0.10(4) e2b2 has been
    extracted for 104Sn. The experi- mental value showed a very good agreement
    with the predicted one and, despite the large error bar, it clearly
    established a downward trend of the B(E2) values of the Sn isotopic chain
    toward A=100. This implied enhanced stability of the N = Z = 50 shell
    closure against ph-excited quadrupole modes. However, an experiment of this
    kind is very challenging for several reasons. First, 104Sn lies in proximity
    of the proton drip line and has therefore a small production cross section,
    second, the high energy of the beam causes a large background which by far
    dominates the γ-ray spectra. To over- come the last aspect, an investigation
    of the components of the background has been performed taking advantage of
    the complexity of the PreSPEC experimental setup, which provides over 1000
    parameters for the detailed analysis of the events. In addi- tion to the
    known radiation produced in atomic processes, evidences of interactions of
    high energy protons, provoking a loss of the detection efficiency and a
    worsening of the quality of the data, have been observed. However, from the
    new information obtained on the background in the PreSPEC data, several
    improvements of the setup are sug- gested in view of new challenging
    experiments in the future with HISPEC/DESPEC at the FAIR facility.
